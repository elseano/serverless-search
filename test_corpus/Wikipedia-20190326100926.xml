The '''Ok Tedi environmental disaster''' caused severe harm to the environment along {{convert|1000|km}} of the [[Ok Tedi River]] and the [[Fly River]] in the [[Western Province (Papua New Guinea)|Western Province of Papua New Guinea]] between about 1984 and 2013. The lives of 50,000 people have been disrupted. One of the worst [[Environmental disaster#List of environmental disasters caused by humans|environmental disasters caused by humans]], it is a consequence of the discharge of about two billion tons of untreated mining waste into the Ok Tedi from the [[Ok Tedi Mine]], an open pit mine in the [[Western Province (Papua New Guinea)|Western Province of Papua New Guinea]].

This mining pollution, caused by the collapse of the Ok Tedi [[tailings dam]] system in 1984 and consequent switch to riverine disposal (disposal of tailings directly into the river) for several decades, was the subject of [[class action]] [[litigation]], naming [[Ok Tedi Mining Limited]] and [[BHP Billiton]] and brought by local landowners. Villagers downstream from Ok Tedi in the Fly River system in the [[Middle Fly District, Western Province|Middle Fly District]] and the southern and central areas of the [[North Fly District, Western Province|North Fly District]],  in particular, believe that the effect on their livelihood from this disaster far outweighs the benefits they have received from the mine's presence in their area.

==Environmental impact==
[[File:Oktedi-landsat.png|alt=Ok Tedi River circa 2007|thumb|Ok Tedi River circa 2007]]
In 1999, BHP reported that 90 million tons of mine waste was annually discharged into the river  for more than ten years and destroyed downstream villages, agriculture and fisheries. Mine wastes were deposited along {{convert|1000|km}} of the Ok Tedi and the Fly River below its confluence with the Ok Tedi, and over an area of {{convert|100|sqkm}}.  BHP's CEO, Paul Anderson, said that the [[Ok Tedi Mine]] was "not compatible with our environmental values and the company should never have become involved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Burton | first = Bob | title = BHP admits Ok Tedi mine is environmental disaster | publisher = [[Asia Times Online]] | date = 13 August 1999 | url = http://www.atimes.com/oceania/AH13Ah01.html | accessdate = 18 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Asof|2006}}, mine operators continued to discharge 80 million tons of [[tailings]], [[overburden]] and mine-induced erosion into the river system each year. About {{convert|1588|sqkm}} of forest has died or is under stress. As many as  {{convert|3000|sqkm}} may eventually be harmed, an area equal to the U.S. state of [[Rhode Island]] or the Danish island of [[Funen]].&lt;ref name="Key"&gt;{{cite web | title = Key Statistics

Following heavy rainfall, mine tailings are swept into the surrounding rain forest, swamps and creeks, and have left behind 30 square kilometers of dead forest. Thick gray sludge from the mine is visible throughout the Fly River system, although its effects downriver are not as severe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, fish counts decrease closer to the mine. The massive amount of mine-derived waste dumped into the river exceeded its carrying capacity. This dumping resulted in the river bed being raised 10 m, causing a relatively deep and slow river to become shallower and develop rapids, thereby disrupting indigenous transportation routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hettler|first=J.|author2=Irion, G. |author3=Lehmann, B. |title=Environmental impact of mining waste disposal on a tropical lowland river system: a case study on the Ok Tedi Mine, Papua New Guinea|journal=Mineralium Deposita|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flooding, caused by the raised riverbed, left a thick layer of contaminated mud on the flood plain among plantations of taro, bananas and sago palm that are the staples of the local diet. About 1300 square kilometers were damaged in this way. The concentration of copper in the water is about 30 times above the standard level, but it is below the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) standards.&lt;ref name="Marychurch"&gt;{{cite web | last =Marychurch | first =Judith | authorlink = |author2=Natalie Stoianoff | title =Blurring the Lines of Environmental Responsibility:  How Corporate and Public Governance was Circumvented in the Ok Tedi Mining Limited Disaster  | work = Australasian Law Teachers Association – Refereed Conference Papers | publisher = | location = Victoria University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia  | date =4–7 July 2006  | url = http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1476&amp;context=lawpapers | format =pdf | doi = | accessdate = 17 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original plans included an Environmental Impact Statement that required a tailings dam be built. This would allow heavy metals and solid particles to settle, before releasing the clean ‘high-water’ into the river system where remaining contaminants would be diluted. In 1984 an earthquake caused the half built dam to collapse. The company continued operations without the dam, initially because BHP argued that it would be too expensive to rebuild it. Subsequently, the PNG government decided a dam wasn’t necessary, in the wake of the closure of the [[Panguna]] mine.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Most of Papua New Guinea's land is held under a system of [[customary land title|native title]], with ownership divided amongst many small clans, while the central government retains control over how resources that lie under the ground are used.

There are no waste retention facilities on the premises. This allowed all ore processing residues, waste rock and overburden to be discharged into the Ok Tedi River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hettler|first=J.|author2=Irion, G. |author3=Lehmann, B. |title=Environmental impact of mining waste disposal on a tropical lowland river system: a case study on the Ok Tedi Mine, Papua New Guinea|journal=Mineralium Deposita|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In the 1990s the communities of the lower [[Western Province, Papua New Guinea|Fly Region]], including the [[Yonggom]] people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

As part of the settlement a (limited) dredging operation was put in place and efforts were made to rehabilitate the site around the mine. However the mine is still in operation and waste continues to flow into the river system.  BHP was granted legal indemnity from future mine related damages.

The Ok Tedi Mine was scheduled to close in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oktedi.com/operations/mine-closure-planning|title=Mine Closure Planning|publisher=OK Tedi Mining Limited|accessdate=16 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207052613/http://www.oktedi.com/operations/mine-closure-planning|archivedate=7 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the PNG Government has taken over control of the mine and with support of local community, the mine life was extended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PNG to take over Ok Tedi|url=http://www.miningnews.net/storyview.asp?storyid=795159826|work=MiningNews.Net|publisher=Aspermont Ltd.|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ok Tedi’s interested parties|url=http://www.pngindustrynews.net/storyview.asp?storyid=801882085|work=PNG Industry News|publisher=Aspermot Ltd.|accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until that time two thirds of the profits go into a long-term fund to enable the mine to continue to contribute to the PNG economy for up to half a century after it closes. The balance is allocated to current development programs in the local area (Western Province) and PNG more generally.  Experts have predicted that it will take 300 years to clean up the toxic contamination.&lt;ref name="The Age Jan 20 2007"&gt;{{cite news

== Mine Life Extension and Community Support ==
In 2013, the PNG Government seized 100% ownership of Ok Tedi Mine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BREAKING NEWS: PNG Govt seizes Ok Tedi|url=http://www.pngindustrynews.net/storyview.asp?storyID=801574086&amp;section=Search&amp;sectionsource=s2377&amp;Highlight=breaking|accessdate=19 September 2013|newspaper=PNG Industry News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and repealed laws that would allow people to sue mining giant BHP Billiton over environmental damage. BHP expressed confidence, stating that it had other indemnities in place that protected shareholders from future legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pngreport.com/png/news/1108384/bhp-confident-despite-threat-of-ok-tedi-legal-action|title=PNG Report - Bhp "Confident" Despite Threat Of Ok Tedi Legal Action|work=PNG Report|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ok Tedi Mining Limited launched the OT2025 project that was focused on transitioning the business to a smaller operation in preparation for Mine Life Extension.

Community consent for the mine’s life to be extended to 2025 was endorsed by the Mine Associated Communities, which is made up of 156 villages, through the signing of the respective Community Mine Continuation Extension Agreements by the Community representatives and OTML at the end of 2012 and beginning of 2013. The signing of the Agreements facilitated the Company to commence planning for the MLE project throughout 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garrett|first=Jemima|title=Community control of Ok Tedi mine assets welcomed in Papua New Guinea's Western Province|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-02-10/an-png-ok-tedi-assets-handover/5250694|work=Australia Network News|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Saemangeum Seawall''', located on the southwest coast of the [[Korean peninsula]], is the world's longest man-made [[Dike (construction)|dyke]], measuring {{convert|33|km|mi}}. It runs between two headlands, and separates the [[Yellow Sea]] and the former [[Saemangeum]] estuary.

[[File:Saemangeum2018.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the Saemangeum Seawall.]]
In 1991, the [[Government of South Korea|South Korean government]] announced that a dyke would be constructed to link three headlands just south of the [[South Korea]]n industrial port city of [[Gunsan]], {{convert|270|km|mi|0}} southwest of [[Seoul]], to create {{convert|400|km2|mi2}} of farmland and a freshwater reservoir.  Since then, the government has spent nearly 2 trillion [[South Korean won|won]] ({{ToUSD|2000|KOR}} billion USD) on construction of the dyke, with another 220 billion won ({{ToUSD|220000|KOR}} million USD) budgeted on strengthening the dyke and a further 1.31 trillion won ({{ToUSD|1310|KOR}} billion USD) to transform the tidal flats into arable land and the reservoir. The average width of the sea wall/earth dam is {{convert|290|m|ft}} (it is {{convert|535|m|ft}} at its widest) and the average height is {{convert|36|m|ft}} ({{convert|54|m|ft}} at its highest).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/policies/view?articleId=89560|title= Saemangeum: a new global city|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The construction of the Saemangeum Seawall has caused controversy from the moment it was announced as environmental groups protested against the impact of the dyke on the local environment.  [[Supreme Court of South Korea|Supreme Court]] challenges in 1999 and 2005 led to temporary production stoppages but ultimately failed to stop the project. Major construction was completed in April 2006, with the seawall {{convert|500|m|ft}} longer than the [[Afsluitdijk]] in the [[IJsselmeer]], the [[Netherlands]], previously the longest seawall-dyke in the world.

With remaining minor construction and inspection finished, the seawall was officially open to the public on April 27, 2010. Then South Korean president [[Lee Myung Bak]] commented that Saemangeum would be "the kernel and the gateway of South Korea's west coast industrial belt", and is "another effort by us for low-carbon and green growth, along with the [[The Four Major Rivers Restoration Project|four-rivers project]]".&lt;ref&gt;

The '''K5 Plan''', '''K5 Belt''' or '''K5 Project''', also known as the '''Bamboo Curtain''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://opus.macmillan.yale.edu/workpaper/pdfs/GS24.pdf Kelvin Rowley, ''Second Life, Second Death: The Khmer Rouge After 1978'', Swinburne University of Technology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216054030/http://opus.macmillan.yale.edu/workpaper/pdfs/GS24.pdf |date=16 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an attempt between 1985 and 1989 by the government of the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] to seal [[Khmer Rouge]] guerrilla infiltration routes into [[Cambodia]] by means of trenches, wire fences, and [[minefield]]s along virtually the entire Thai–Cambodian border.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Margaret Slocomb, ''The People's Republic of Kampuchea, 1979-1989: The revolution after Pol Pot'' {{ISBN|978-974-9575-34-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Cambodia anti-PRK border camps.png|thumb|240px|Border camps hostile to the PRK; 1979-1984]]
After the defeat of [[Democratic Kampuchea]] in 1979, the [[Khmer Rouge]] fled Cambodia quickly. Protected by the Thai state, and with powerful foreign connections, [[Pol Pot]]'s virtually intact militia of about 30,000 to 35,000 troops regrouped and reorganized in forested and mountainous zones behind the Thai-Cambodian border. During the early 1980s Khmer Rouge forces showed their strength in [[Thailand]], inside the refugee camps near the border, and were able to receive a steady and abundant supply of military equipment. The weapons came mainly from China and the US and were channeled across Thailand with the cooperation of the [[Royal Thai Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name="yale.edu"&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/cgp/thailand_response.html Puangthong Rungswasdisab, ''Thailand's Response to the Cambodian Genocide'']&lt;/ref&gt;

From their position of security in hidden military outposts along the Thai border, the Khmer Rouge militias launched a relentless military campaign against the newly established People's Republic of Kampuchea state. Even though the Khmer Rouge was dominant, it fought against the [[Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Armed Forces]] (KPRAF) and [[Vietnam People's Army]] along with minor non-communist armed factions which had formerly been fighting against the Khmer Rouge between 1975 and 1979.

The border war followed a [[wet season]] / [[dry season]] rhythm. Generally, the heavily armed Vietnamese forces conducted offensive operations during the dry seasons, and the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge held the initiative during the rainy seasons. In 1982, Vietnam launched a largely unsuccessful offensive against the main Khmer Rouge base at [[Phnom Malai]] in the [[Cardamom Mountains]].

The major consequence of the border civil war was that the PRK was hampered in its efforts to rebuild the much-damaged nation and consolidate its administration. The new republic's rule was tenuous in the border areas owing to persistent sabotage by the Khmer Rouge of the provincial administrative system through constant guerrilla warfare.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Implementation==
The architect of the K5 plan was Vietnamese general [[Lê Đức Anh]], commander of the PAVN forces in Cambodia. He formulated five key points for the defence of Cambodia against Khmer Rouge re-infiltration. Letter "K", the first letter of the [[Khmer alphabet]], came from ''kar karpier'', meaning 'defence' in the [[Khmer language]], and number "5" referred to Le Duc Anh's five points in his plan of defence, of which the sealing of the border with [[Thailand]] was the second point.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Many workers on the project, however, did not know what "K5" stood for.&lt;ref&gt;Esmeralda Luciolli, ''Le mur de bambou, ou le Cambodge après Pol Pot.'' {{ISBN|2-905538-33-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The K5 Plan began on 19 July 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://khmercanada.site.voila.fr/cambodge82.htm Chronologie du Cambodge de 1960 à 1990 - from Raoul M. Jennar, ''Les clés du Cambodge'']&lt;/ref&gt; It became a gigantic effort that included [[clearcutting|clearing]] long patches of [[tropical forest]] by felling a great number of trees, as well as slashing and uprooting tall vegetation. 
The purpose was to leave a continuous broad open space all along the Thai border that would be watched and mined.

In practice the K5 fence consisted of a roughly 700&amp;nbsp;km-long, 500 m-wide swath of land along the border with Thailand, where [[antitank mine|antitank]] and [[antipersonnel mine]]s were buried to a density of about 3,000 mines per kilometre of frontage.&lt;ref&gt;Landmine Monitor Report 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
From the [[ecology|environmental viewpoint]] the massive felling of trees was an [[ecological disaster]], contributing to acute [[deforestation]], the endangerment of species, and leaving behind a vast [[Land degradation|degraded area]]. The more remote places, like the [[Cardamom Mountains]] had been relatively untouched by man until they became a stronghold of the Khmer Rouge in the 1980s. Presently these mountains form an endangered [[ecoregion]].

Unforeseen by the planners of the project, from the [[Military strategy|military point of view]] the K5 Plan was also disastrous for the PRK. It did not deter the Khmer Rouge fighters who found ways to cross it, for it was impossible to effectively police the long border. Besides, maintenance was difficult, as the razed jungle left a scruffy undergrowth that, in the tropical climate, would grow again yearly to about a man's height.&lt;ref name="Soizick Crochet 1997"&gt;Soizick Crochet, ''Le Cambodge'', Karthala, Paris 1997, {{ISBN|2-86537-722-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The K5 Plan was counterproductive for the image of the PRK, as a republic bent on reconstructing what the rule of Pol Pot and his [[Communist Party of Kampuchea]] had destroyed in Cambodia. Despite the magnitude of the effort, the whole project was ultimately unsuccessful and ended up playing into the hands of the enemies of the new pro-[[Hanoi]] republic. Thousands of Cambodian peasants, who despite the Vietnamese invasion had welcomed the release from the Khmer Rouge's interference in traditional farming and the absence of taxes under the PRK government,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; became irritated. They were sore at having to abandon their farms in order to dedicate time to clear the jungle, a heavy toil they perceived as useless and unfruitful.&lt;ref name="Soizick Crochet 1997"/&gt; Their resentment grew in time as they perceived the new forced labor to be, albeit without the killings, very similar to what they had experienced under the Khmer Rouge tyranny.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Margaret Slocomb, ''The K5 Gamble: National Defence and Nation Building under the People's Republic of Kampuchea'' Journal of Southeast Asian Studies (2001), 32 : 195-210 Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to unsanitary conditions and the abundance of [[mosquitoes]] in areas of difficult access, badly fed and badly lodged workers on the K5 project fell victims of [[malaria]] and exhaustion.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Etcheson, ''After the killing fields: lessons from the Cambodian genocide'', {{ISBN|978-0-275-98513-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the mines remain to this day, making the vast long area dangerous. The K5 zone became part of the great landmine problem in Cambodia after the end of the civil war. In 1990 alone, the number of Cambodians that had a leg or foot amputated as a result of an injury caused by a land mine reached around 6,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13217914.300-the-killing-minefields-of-cambodia.html?full=true NewScientist - ''The killing minefields of Cambodia '']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Borneo fires October 2006.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Satellite photograph of the haze above [[Borneo]]]]
The '''2006 Southeast Asian haze''' event was caused by continued uncontrolled burning from "[[slash and burn]]" cultivation in [[Indonesia]], and affected several countries in the Southeast Asian region and beyond, such as [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], southern [[Thailand]], and as far as [[Saipan]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?cat=1&amp;newsID=61706 |title=Indon haze spreads to NMI |accessdate=8 October 2006 |publisher=saipantribune.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218044848/http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?cat=1&amp;newsID=61706 |archivedate=18 February 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the effects of the haze may have spread to [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/natural_hazards_v2.php3?img_id=13927|title=Haze over Korea |author=[[NASA]]|date=13 October 2006|accessdate=30 October 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070803001633/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/natural_hazards_v2.php3?img_id=13927 |archivedate = 3 August 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local sources of pollution partly contributed to the increased [[toxicity]], particularly in high-pollution areas such as ports, [[oil refineries]], and dense urban areas. In the highly urbanised and industrialised [[Klang Valley]] of Malaysia in particular, the surrounding terrain acted as a natural retainer of polluted air, aggravating the situation when the [[haze]] set in.

There is also a link to [[El Niño]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2007/elnino_wildfire.html|title=NASA Data Links Indonesian Wildfire Flare-Up to Recent El Nino|accessdate=3 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The haze was made worse than during previous occurrences by the [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] which delayed the year's monsoon season. Fires in Kalimantan produce great amounts of smoke, burn a long time and are difficult to extinguish because they are on [[peat]]land, and once lit the fires can burn for months and release gases that produce [[sulphuric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Arijit. 31 October 2006.

===Indonesia===
The fires originated mostly in [[Kalimantan]], the Indonesian part of [[Borneo]], and on [[Sumatra]], where they are set by [[swidden]] agriculturists employed by agroforestry concerns to clear land to grow pulp woods or market crops ahead of the [[Tillage|growing]] season. Satellite images taken over Borneo on 4 October showing 561 "hot spots" areas where fires had been set.

Officials in neighbouring countries accused Indonesian officials of doing nothing to stop the fires, though forestry ministry officials said they had [[firefighting|firefighters]] working to douse the [[forest fire|blazes]] on state-controlled land. However, they conceded, most of the fires were on private land.&lt;ref&gt;Agence France-Presse.6 October 2006.

Cities affected include [[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]], [[West Kalimantan]], [[Palangkaraya]], [[Central Kalimantan]] and [[Pekanbaru]], [[Riau]].&lt;ref&gt;Agence France-Presse. 5 October 2006.

A 20 October report by Malaysian government news agency [[BERNAMA]] offered a first-hand account of the scene in Kalimantan: "The suffocating smell of smoke, sore throat and eyes got worse when this reporter and a photographer stepped foot in central Kalimantan, forcing them to put on face masks. Throughout the 200-kilometre journey from Banjarmasin to Palangkaraya, what could be seen of the forests on both sides of the road was a landscape of blackish soil with smoke still billowing from the ground in some areas and of withering trees and plants. The area was foggy and dusty as the air was filled with flying ashes and other particles."

Local villagers, the report said, appeared to be unconcerned with the smog, saying it was "normal". "If we do not burn the forest, where are we going to get our food from?" a villager said.&lt;ref&gt;Madian, Amrizan. 20 October 2006.

On the environmental front, fires destroyed 1&amp;nbsp;km² of the [[Tesso Nilo National Park]] in [[Riau|Riau Province]].&lt;ref name="delay"&gt;{{cite news|title=Unhealthy air may last for a few weeks|author=Tan, Tania|work=Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=17 October 2006|page=1|publisher=[[Singapore Press Holdings]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Tanjung Puting National Park]] in [[Central Kalimantan]], the haze adversely affected the [[orangutan]]s.&lt;ref name="delay"/&gt;

===Malaysia===

The effects of the haze started in early July and affected the northern [[Malaysia]]n states severely.&lt;ref&gt;The __earthinc. [http://maddruid.com/?p=825 Of possible return of haze] 4 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- WP:RS - no blogs allowed. If possible, find better source. --&gt; However, the haze had cleared substantially throughout [[Peninsular Malaysia]] from 29 August 2006 due to the arrival of the rainy season. The rain reduced the number of hotspots throughout Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. On 30 August 2006, ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'' reported that Kuala Lumpur would be free of haze during the Independence Day. In the late evening just before midnight on 31 August 2006, the visibility in the Klang Valley was recorded to be very good.

Unfortunately, the haze returned again in late September when Muslim Malaysians were experiencing [[Ramadan]]. This was partly due to a change of wind direction towards the southwest, partially caused by [[Typhoon Xangsane]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Brunei Times]]. Filipino wind of change. 3 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The worst hit place was [[Kuching]].

For now, many people are wearing [[mask]]s to prevent themselves from inhaling excessive amounts of haze. On 7 October, [[visibility]] in parts of [[East Malaysia]] fell to 300&amp;nbsp;metres. On or about 9 October, the worst of the haze in Peninsular seemed to be in the state of [[Negeri Sembilan]], where [[visibility]] in [[Sepang]] fell briefly to 500&amp;nbsp;metres and the [[Air Pollution Index|API]] in [[Nilai]] reached 198, before the rain relieved the haze partially. Shortly thereafter changing winds caused conditions to improve rapidly. [[Sarawak]] has started [[cloud seeding]] attempts to try to encourage rainfall that will help relieve the haze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/10/7/nation/15661601&amp;sec=nation |accessdate=8 October 2006 |title=Malaysians have had enough of haze woes |publisher=The Star Online |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220034848/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2006%2F10%2F7%2Fnation%2F15661601&amp;sec=nation |archivedate=20 December 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each cloud seeding session costs at least [[Ringgit Malaysia|RM]]50,000 (roughly US$14,000).&lt;ref&gt;The Star.

While the haze largely spared Singapore with 24-hour [[Pollutant Standards Index]] readings within the "Good" range for 15 days in September and the rest in the "Moderate" range and no higher than a reading of 66,&lt;ref name="PSI"&gt;{{cite web|title=PSI Reading for Singapore|publisher=Singapore [[National Environment Agency]]|url=http://app.nea.gov.sg/cms/htdocs/article_frm.asp?pid=2780|accessdate=14 October 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023131842/http://app.nea.gov.sg/cms/htdocs/article_frm.asp?pid=2780|archivedate=23 October 2006|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; its harmful effects became more prevalent in October.

On 7 October 2006, the 3-hour PSI reading breached the 100 mark at 8&amp;nbsp;a.m. and entered unhealthy levels for the first time in the year, as winds from neighbouring [[Sumatra]] blew the haze to Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://app.nea.gov.sg/cms/htdocs/article.asp?pid=2777 |accessdate=7 October 2006 |title=Haze update 7 Oct 2006 |publisher=[[National Environment Agency]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611034917/http://app.nea.gov.sg/cms/htdocs/article.asp?pid=2777 |archivedate=11 June 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; At 10&amp;nbsp;a.m., it hit 130, the highest in three years, before subsiding to 80 at 4&amp;nbsp;p.m. and climbing rapidly to 150 at 9&amp;nbsp;p.m.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/234369/1/.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20061023005348/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/234369/1/.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 October 2006|accessdate=8 October 2006|title=Haze worsens in Singapore, PSI hits new high for the year|publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the worst since 1997, before ending the day at 136, still in the unhealthy range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/a1news/20061007_story1_3.html|title=Singapore records worst pollution reading in 10 years|accessdate=8 October 2006|publisher=[[asiaone News]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061103061347/http://news.asiaone.com/a1news/20061007_story1_3.html  |archivedate = 3 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the air quality was set to improve with the arrival of the [[Northeast monsoon]] rains in mid-October, southeasterly winds extended the hazy season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayonline.com/articles/148867.asp|accessdate=16 October 2006|title=A grey start to the week|publisher=[[TODAYOnline]]}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mild [[El Niño]] effect delayed the starting of the showers to late October or early November,&lt;ref name="delay"/&gt; or even until the end of November. The prolonged haze could be attributed to the extended dry season, which put the rains on hold and affected wind patterns which brought the haze to Singapore. Intermittent showers could occur in the pre-monsoon period, but these would do little in increasing air quality. The unpredictable winds in the pre-monsoon period could bring haze from either Sumatra or Kalimantan.&lt;ref name="more delay"&gt;{{cite news|title=Late rains mean haze may stay till end-Nov|author1=Tan, Tania  |author2=Peh, Shing Huei|work=Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=21 October 2006|page=1|publisher=[[Singapore Press Holdings]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air quality remained in the moderate range for the next week&lt;ref name="PSI"/&gt; until 14 October, when the 3-hour PSI readings gradually increased from 53 at 6&amp;nbsp;a.m. to peak at an unhealthy 116 at 10&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="Oct14"&gt;{{cite news|

Later in October, though, the situation began to improve, with the PSI hitting a low of 11 at 2&amp;nbsp;p.m. on 26 October.

However, in early November, intermonsoonal winds brought slight haze back to Singapore, with the 3-hour PSI in the moderate range most of the time.

The highest 3-hour average PSI recorded prior to that point 226 in September 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|

====Impact====
While some Singaporeans began donning face masks, others frequented shopping malls and public places like [[VivoCity]], with many shopping before [[Deepavali]] at [[Little India, Singapore|Little India]],&lt;ref name="Shrouded"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/235631/1/.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20061023161202/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/235631/1/.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 October 2006|accessdate=15 October 2006|title=Singapore shrouded in haze, public urged to reduce vigorous outdoor activity|publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and going to [[Geylang Serai]]'s annual [[Hari Raya]] bazaar.

The government announced plans for a haze action plan if the situation became "extremely dangerous", which included priority treatment for haze-related illnesses.&lt;ref name="Action plan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/235784/1/.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20061023161303/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/235784/1/.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 October 2006|accessdate=16 October 2006|title=Haze action plan to kick in if PSI hits extremely dangerous level|publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health Minister [[Khaw Boon Wan]] said that there was "very little that (could) be done to stop the haze", and advised people to remain indoors, especially those with prior respiratory conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/236219/1/.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20061019011403/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/236219/1/.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 October 2006|accessdate=18 October 2006|title=Health Minister hopes preventive measures will be taken to stop haze in future|publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some minor haze-related illness began to surface, but free clinics across the island did not report any increase in patients with this symptoms.&lt;ref name="Oct14"/&gt; However, attendance figures at [[polyclinic]]s islandwide increased by 600 cases to about 15,000 cases of haze-related conditions in the first week of October as compared to the same period last month.&lt;ref name="Action plan"/&gt; This is despite the [[National Healthcare Group]] reporting that the number of people "complaining of the same ailments" has decreased from the same period last year.&lt;ref name="Worse in west"&gt;{{cite news|title=Singapore's smoke central|author1=Tan, Tania  |author2=Lim, Jessica|work=Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=20 October 2006|page=6|publisher=[[Singapore Press Holdings]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Air purifier]] sales shot up during the hazy period. [[Best Denki]], an electronic store, sold [[Singapore dollar|S$]]350,000 worth of air purifiers and related items in 4 days, a 300 percent increase. However, experts from the Institute of Environmental Science &amp; Engineering at the [[Nanyang Technological University]] said that only some of these products, like High Efficiency Particulate [[air filter]]s, would effectively remove small particles from air. Other kinds of air purifiers like [[air ionizer|ionizing purifiers]] gave off [[ozone]] which could cause symptoms similar to those caused by the haze. The experts recommended regularly cleaning the filter media and opening windows to get some fresh air at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/236697/1/.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20061023162310/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/236697/1/.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 October 2006|accessdate=21 October 2006|title=Sales of air purifiers increase by more than two-fold as haze persists|publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[West Region, Singapore|western region]], which includes [[Boon Lay]], [[Choa Chu Kang]] and [[Jurong]], seemed to be the "[[epicentre]]" of the haze. Residents there complained of the worse conditions in their area, saying that it felt "hotter than usual", and health problems were more widespread. The air quality levels in the west may have consistently been the worst, but only by several points. Some speculated that the more polluted air was caused by the many construction sites and [[industrial park]]s in [[Jurong]], but NEA refuted this, claiming that they did not contribute to the haze. Polyclinics in Jurong and [[Bukit Batok]] had an increase of 20 percent admission for patients with respiratory problems and [[asthma]].&lt;ref name="Worse in west"/&gt;

Schools islandwide restricted outdoor activities and had to rethink post-examination activities and training or revert to wet-weather programmes. The [[Singapore Sports School]]'s swim team had to cut back on training when the haze reached unhealthy levels even though they were in the midst of various international competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/235970/1/.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20061023161426/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/235970/1/.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 October 2006|accessdate=17 October 2006|title=Sports School training affected by haze, outdoor activities cut back|publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|Ministry of Education]] recommended that schools suspend all outdoor activities when the PSI reading passes 100, but some schools chose to move indoors regardless of the PSI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jurong schools moved more activities indoors|author=Lim, Jessica|work=Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=20 October 2006|page=6|publisher=[[Singapore Press Holdings]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Singaporean "fitness buffs" also made the move indoors. [[Fitness club]]s reported increases in turn-outs and check-ins, utilising gym facilities rather than outdoor activities. [[Rock climbing|Rock climbers]] were also affected, and began to move activities indoors instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/236825/1/.html|accessdate=21 October 2006|title=Fitness buffs heading indoors to exercise to beat the haze|publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The haze also caused increased sales and rental of entertainment [[Video CD|VCD]] and DVD titles, but cinema attendance was unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/235636/1/.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20061102232437/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/235636/1/.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2 November 2006|accessdate=16 October 2006|title=Hazy days drive up demand for entertainment DVDs and VCDs|publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Environment Agency website received about 170,000 hits on 14 October, as compared to the usual 60,000, and caused the server to temporarily go down due to the sheer volume of traffic.&lt;ref name="delay"/&gt;

According to economists, Singapore suffered a US$50 million economic loss due to the onset of the haze in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/235112/1/.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20061022152817/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/235112/1/.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=22 October 2006|title=Economic loss estimated at US$50&amp;nbsp;m since the start of the haze|accessdate=14 October 2006|publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thailand===
In July, the southern [[Thailand|Thai]] provinces of [[Pattani Province|Pattani]] and [[Satun Province|Satun]] suffered an on-and-off bout of smog, with the levels of pollutants in Satun being high enough to constitute a health hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=106974|accessdate=8 October 2006|title=Indonesia smog covers two provinces|publisher=bangkokpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all, seven provinces were affected by the haze in July and August.

Haze was again reported on 6 October, with respiratory illnesses and eye irritation reported in [[Narathiwat Province|Narathiwat]].&lt;ref&gt;Thai News Agency. 6 October 2006. [http://etna.mcot.net/query.php?nid=25233 "Indonesian forest fire smog again blankets southern Thailand"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009083544/http://etna.mcot.net/query.php?nid=25233 |date=9 October 2006 }}, MCOT.&lt;/ref&gt; Visibility and air quality were also affected in [[Songkhla Province|Songkhla]], Satun and [[Yala Province|Yala]]. Health warnings were issued and [[surgical mask]]s were issued to residents. Three days later, meteorological officials reported that the haze had thinned to almost normal visibility.&lt;ref&gt;Thai News Agency. 9 October 2006.

Strong winds in the region brought haze from Indonesia back into Songkhla, Satun, Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat provinces on 17 October. Visibility in Yala and Songkhla was reduced to less than a kilometre, and officials warned fishermen going out to the [[Andaman Sea]] and [[Gulf of Thailand]] to "stay vigilant". Drivers were also asked to turn on their headlights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etna.mcot.net/query.php?nid=25459 |accessdate=17 October 2006 |title=Indonesian smog returns to southern Thailand |publisher=TNA English News }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaysia and Singapore criticised the way Indonesia handled the issue. Both urged the latter to ratify the [[ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution]]. The Malaysian Environment Minister [[Azmi Khalid]] said "Frustration is an understatement", directed toward Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]].

[[File:TOMS indonesia smog lrg.jpg|upright=1.6|thumb|Air pollution over Southeast Asia in October 1997]]
The '''1997 Southeast Asian haze''' was a large-scale air quality disaster that occurred during the second half of 1997, its after-effects causing widespread atmospheric visibility and health problems within [[Southeast Asia]]. The total costs of the Southeast Asian haze are estimated at [[United States dollar|US$]]9 billion, due mainly to health care and disruption of air travel and business activities.

The influence of the [[1997 Indonesian forest fires|1997 fires in Kalimantan and Sumatra]] on ambient air quality was evident by July and peaked in September/October before weakening by November, when the delayed [[monsoon|monsoonal rain]] extinguished the fires and improved air quality within the region. During the peak episode, satellite imagery (NASA/TOMS aerosol index maps) showed a haze layer that expanded over an area of more than {{convert|3000000|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}}, covering large parts of [[Sumatra]] and [[Kalimantan]]. Its northward extension partially reached [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Brunei]] and [[Thailand]]. During this period, [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] concentrations frequently exceeded national ambient air quality standards. Monthly mean horizontal visibility at most locations in Sumatra and Kalimantan in September was below {{convert|1|km|abbr= on}} and daily maximum visibility was frequently below {{convert|100|m|abbr=out}}.

==Countries affected==
* [[Indonesia]]
* [[Singapore]]
* [[Malaysia]]
* [[Thailand]]
* [[Brunei]]

==Causes==

The 1997 Southeast Asian haze was caused mainly by [[slash-and-burn]] techniques adopted by farmers in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://haze.asean.org/docs/1272361130/Jambi%2BCollaboration%2BBooklet_English%2B(reduced).pdf/view&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=wAXjT7rbA8btrQfmh4i4Aw&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAG&amp;usg=AFQjCNESJ5UpfPRVFGOxrRzEFf-LTVQiyg Jambi Collaboration Booklet_English (reduced).pdf - Asean]{{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Slash and burn has been extensively used for many years as the cheapest and easiest means to clear the lands for traditional agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol9/iss1/art15/ |title=The Role of Fire in Changing Land Use and Livelihoods in Riau-Sumatra |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fire is also used during the long fallow rotation of the so-called jungle rubber in Sumatra and Kalimantan to remove most of the [[biomass]], including the woody parts before new plantations are re-established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldagroforestry.org/sea/Publications/files/journal/JA0132-04.pdf |title=Farmers' perspectives on slash-and-burn as a land clearing method for small-scale rubber producers in Sepunggur, Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fire may also be deliberately used as a weapon to claim property on the islands and provinces where land ownership is not clear, an action taken by both smallholders and large operators alike. After burning out its previous owner, the smallholder or large operator plants their own crops there, gaining de facto control over the disputed land {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.

During the dry season, dry fuels readily ignite and lead to large wildfires, and due to the [[1997–98 El Niño event]], the dry season in Southeast Asia was even drier than normal. These accidental fires may have the same underlying socio-economic and institutional problems. In cases like this, fire suppression can be very difficult and costly especially when they reach the highly flammable peat-swamp areas.

==Effects==
[[Atmospheric particulate matter]] was the form of air pollutant that predominantly contributed to the haze and degradation in ambient air quality standards during this crisis. In all countries affected by the smoke [[haze]], an increase of acute health outcomes was observed. Health effects; included emergency room visits due to respiratory symptoms such as [[asthma]], [[upper respiratory infection]], decreased lung function as well as eye and skin irritation, were caused mainly by this [[granular material|particulate matter]]. In Singapore, for instance, health surveillance showed a 30% increase in hospital attendance due to air quality related symptoms. Generally, children and the elderly, as well as those with pre-existing respiratory and [[cardiac disease]]s were the most susceptible to adverse health outcomes from the [[haze]] exposure. The smoke haze episode has added to the urban and industrial air pollution in [[Southeast Asia]], causing it to reach alarming levels in many metropolitan areas.

By scattering and absorbing light, the fire-related particulate also resulted in reduced [[visibility]]; impairing transportation by air, land and water and seriously affecting the economies of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Among the economic sectors affected most were air, land and sea transportation, construction, tourism and agricultural industries. [[EEPSEA]]/[[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] roughly estimated the economic value of the damages caused by the 1997 fires and haze. They estimated one billion US$ from haze-related damages for Indonesia only. The damages to Malaysia and Singapore are figured at 0.4 billion US$. Including the fire related damages, the total damages are estimated to amount to 4.5 billion US$. However, a variety of the damages such as decreased quality of life, loss of biodiversity and atmospheric impacts are difficult to establish.

Fire-related smoke haze episodes also reveal a social component: a large part of the population in Southeast Asia do not have the financial means to buy protective measures such as respiratory masks and air conditioning, nor are they able to refrain from outdoor work when air pollution is high.

[[File:TOMS indonesia smog lrg.jpg|thumb|350px|Air pollution over Southeast Asia in October 1997.]]
The '''1997 group of [[forest fire]]s in [[Indonesia]]''' that lasted well into 1998 were probably among the two or three, if not ''the'' largest, forest fires group in the last two centuries of recorded history.

In the middle of 1997 forest fires burning in Indonesia began to affect neighbouring countries, spreading thick clouds of smoke and haze to [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]. Then Malaysian Prime Minister [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] searched desperately for a solution,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=19971108&amp;id=cLBOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MRUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5399,1353 New Straits Times - Nov 8, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; and based on a plan by the head of the Malaysian fire and rescue department sent a team of Malaysian firefighters across to Indonesia under code name [[Operation Haze]]. This is to mitigate the effect of the Haze to Malaysia economy. The value of the Haze damage to Malaysian GDP is estimated to be 0.30 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eMBu_rXSq3QC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=operation+haze+malaysia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IOY8RfxPyk&amp;sig=kXuKaptYi5e1PUzEYjv_IZjfhnU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VQp3T5_nHMHirAfioMSuDQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=operation%20haze%20malaysia&amp;f=false Indonesia's Fires and Haze: The Cost of Catastrophe  By David Glover, Timothy Jessup, page 46]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Seasonal rains in early December brought a brief respite but soon after the dry conditions and fires returned. By 1998 [[Brunei]] and to a lesser extent [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]] and the [[Philippines]] had also felt the haze from the [[smoke]] of the forest fires. By the time the 1997-98 forest fires were finally over some 8 million hectares of land had burned while countless millions of people suffered from air pollution.

== Causes and effect ==
The 1997 Indonesian forest fires were caused by changing land use which made the tropical forest vulnerable to fire during a drought associated with that year's [[El Niño]]. Indonesian forests have historically been resistant to burning even during long dry seasons and despite the use of fire to clear land for [[Slash-and-burn|swidden]] agriculture. The land use changes that led to the fires were a combination of industrial-scale logging, draining peatlands for conversion to oil palm and fast-growing tree plantations, and a massive government program to drain swamps and convert them to rice paddies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Why_Forests_Why_Now.html?id=WWx6rgEACAAJ|title=Why Forests? Why Now?: The Science, Economics, and Politics of Tropical Forests and Climate Change|last=Seymour|first=Frances|last2=Busch|first2=Jonah|date=2016|publisher=Center for Global Development|year=|isbn=9781933286853|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 240 people perished in the wildfires.&lt;ref name="Worst Wildfires"&gt;{{cite web |title=Capter 3 It Only Takes A Spark: The Hazard of Wildfires |url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ND-Review-Chapter-3.pdf |publisher=Brookings.edu |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Estimated cost ==
The total economic value of the damages are conservatively estimated to be US$4.47 billion, of which by far the largest share was borne by Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=eMBu_rXSq3QC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=1997+indonesia+forest+fire+causes&amp;ots=IQXaWoxOuq&amp;sig=x0CIVO5azr4Wj0hSzuBBGrdBTSg#v=onepage&amp;q=1997%20indonesia%20forest%20fire%20causes&amp;f=false|title=Indonesia's Fires and Haze: The Cost of Catastrophe|last=Glover|first=David|date=2006|publisher=IDRC|isbn=9781552503324|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure excludes a number of damages that are especially difficult to measure or to value in monetary terms, such as loss of human life, long term health impacts, and some biodiversity losses.

Forest fires in Indonesia in 1997 were estimated to have released between 0.81 and 2.57 gigatonnes of carbon into the atmosphere, which is between 13-40% of the annual [[carbon dioxide]] emissions from burning [[fossil fuels]].,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://climate.ncas.ac.uk/people/allan/Seasonal_Forecasting_papers/harrison_09_global_impact_indonesian_forest_fires.pdf The global impact of Indonesian forest fires]'', Mark E Harrison, Susan E Page, and Suwido H Limin, [[Biologist]], Volume 56 Number 3, August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.monitor.net/monitor/0211a/rainfire2.html Indonesia Rainforest Fires Doubled CO2 Levels Globally]{{Dead link|date=February 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'', Cat Lazaroff, [[Albion Monitor]], 5 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of steps taken to avoid the recurring of the Haze, the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) approved the need for an early warning system in the Regional Haze Action Plan (RHAP) in 1998 to prevent forest fires and the resulting haze through improved management policies and enforcements, example via Fire Danger Rating System (FDRS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wamis.org/agm/meetings/wofire08/S2-Zaki_Malaysia.pdf OPERATIONAL FDR IN MALAYSIA AND ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIA NATIONS]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Al-Mishraq,''' or '''Mishraq Sulphur State Company,''' is a state run [[sulfur]] plant near [[Mosul]], [[Iraq]].

It has twice been set alight and burned for prolonged periods. In 2003, what is thought to have been a deliberately started fire, burned for about three weeks, resulting in the largest human-made release of [[sulfur dioxide]] ever recorded. In 2016 it was set alight by [[ISIL]] and burned for seven days.

==Fires==
In June 2003, it was the site of the largest human-made release of [[sulfur dioxide]] ever recorded when a fire (thought to have been deliberately started) gained control and burned for about three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3955005.stm|title=Iraq sulphur fire breaks records|date=26 October 2004|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its height, the fire was putting 21,000 tons of sulfur dioxide a day into the atmosphere. The pollution in [[Mosul]], which is about 45 kilometres from Mishraq, reached a catastrophic level. For over 48 hours the white smoke from sulfur dioxide could be seen in the air. Many people were taken into hospitals and most vegetation was killed.

On 22 October 2016 the plant was set alight by [[ISIL]] militants as part of the [[Battle of Mosul (2016)|Battle of Mosul]]. Two civilians died and nearly 1,000 people were treated for toxic gas inhalation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mosul battle: Hundreds treated over toxic fumes in Iraq|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37738667|accessdate=22 October 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shifting winds sent the gas to [[Qayyarah Airfield West]], where U.S. and coalition forces were forced to use gas masks.&lt;ref name="abc1022"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Latest: Abadi: Kirkuk Nearly Secured After IS Attack|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/latest-iraqi-army-launches-push-town-mosul-42982676|accessdate=22 October 2016|publisher=ABC News|date=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total mass of the released sulfur dioxide was estimated to approximately 161,000 tons distributed over seven days, equivalent to a small volcanic eruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Björnham |first1=0.|last2=Grahn |first2=H.|last3=von Schoenberg |first3=P.|last4=Liljedahl |first4=B.|last5=Waleij |first5=A.|last6=Brännström |first6=N. |title=The 2016 Al-Mishraq sulphur plant fire: Source and health risk area estimation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231017306167 |date=September 2017|journal=Atmospheric Environment|volume=169 |page=287–296| doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.09.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=“veconomist” &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=It will take years to clear up the rubble in the Middle East|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21730166-want-shovel-it-will-take-years-clear-up-rubble-middle-east|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kuwaiti oil fires''' were caused by [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]]i [[Military of Iraq|military forces]] setting fire to a reported 605 to 732 [[oil well]]s along with an unspecified number of oil filled low-lying areas, such as oil lakes and fire [[trench]]es, as part of a [[scorched earth]] policy while retreating from [[Kuwait]] in 1991 due to the advances of [[Coalition of Gulf War|Coalition]] military forces in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]]. The fires were started in January and February 1991, and the first [[oil well fire|well fires]] were extinguished in early April 1991, with the last well capped on November 6, 1991.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/owf_ii/owf_ii_s03.htm#III.%20CHRONOLOGY%20OF%20EVENTS |title=III.

==Motives==
[[File:Oil well fires, south of Kuwait City, 1991.jpg|thumb|Oil well fires, south of Kuwait City. (Photo taken from inside a UH-60 Blackhawk; the door frame is the black bar on the right of the photo)]]
The dispute between Iraq and Kuwait over alleged [[Directional drilling|slant-drilling]] in the [[Rumaila oil field]] was one of the reasons for [[Gulf War|Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990]].&lt;ref name=GT-DEX-1990-01&gt;Thomas C. Hayes, [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/03/world/confrontation-in-the-gulf-the-oilfield-lying-below-the-iraq-kuwait-dispute.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF; The Oilfield Lying Below the Iraq-Kuwait Dispute], ''The New York Times'', September 3, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GT-DEX-1990-02&gt;{{cite book|last=J.

[[File:Kuwaiti Oil Well Fire.jpg|thumb|right|Kuwaiti oil well fire, south of Kuwait City, March, 1991]]
In addition, Kuwait had been producing oil above treaty limits established by [[OPEC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas C. Hayes|title=CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF; The Oilfield Lying Below the Iraq-Kuwait Dispute|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/03/world/confrontation-in-the-gulf-the-oilfield-lying-below-the-iraq-kuwait-dispute.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm|publisher=The New York Times|date=September 3, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the eve of the Iraqi invasion, Kuwait had set production quotas to almost {{convert|1.9|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}}, which coincided with a sharp drop in the price of oil. By the summer of 1990, Kuwaiti overproduction had become a serious point of contention with Iraq.

Some analysts have speculated that one of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s main motivations in invading Kuwait was to punish the ruling [[al-Sabah family]] in Kuwait for not stopping its policy of overproduction, as well as his reasoning behind the destruction of said wells.&lt;ref name="TED"&gt;{{cite web

It is also hypothesized that Iraq decided to destroy the oil fields to achieve a military advantage, believing the intense smoke plumes serving as [[smoke screen]]s created by the burning oil wells would inhibit Coalition offensive [[air strikes]], foil allied [[Precision-guided munition|precision guided weapons]] and spy satellites,&lt;ref name="articles.baltimoresun.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-01-23/news/1991023131_1_kuwait-saddam-hussein-sagan |title=PAGE 1 OF 2: Burning oil wells could be disaster, Sagan says January 23, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; and could screen Iraq’s military movements. Furthermore, it is thought that Iraq’s military leaders may have regarded the heat, smoke, and debris from hundreds of burning oil wells as presenting a formidable [[area denial]] obstacle to Coalition forces. The onset of the oil well destruction supports this military dimension to the sabotage of the wells; for example, during the early stage of the Coalition air campaign, the number of oil wells afire was relatively small but the number increased dramatically in late February with the arrival of the ground war.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/owf_ii/owf_ii_s03.htm |title=III. CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS A. Discussion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iraqi military [[combat engineers]] also released oil into low-lying areas for defensive purposes against infantry and [[mechanized warfare|mechanized units]] along Kuwait’s southern border, by constructing several "fire trenches" roughly 1 kilometer long, 3 meters wide, and 3 meters deep to impede the advance of Coalition ground forces.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

The military use of the land based fires should also be seen in context with the coinciding, deliberate, sea based [[Gulf War oil spill]], the apparent strategic goal of which was to foil a potential [[amphibious landing]] by U.S. [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]].&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/05/03/2888880.htm |title=Timeline: 20 years of major oil spills |date=May 4, 2010 |work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extent==
[[File:F-14A VF-114 over burning Kuwaiti oil well 1991.JPEG|left|thumb| The Kuwaiti oil fires were not just limited to burning oil wells, one of which is seen here in the background, but burning "oil lakes", seen in the foreground, also contributed to the smoke plumes, particularly the [[soot]]iest/blackest of them (1991).&lt;ref name="gulflink.osd.mil"/&gt; ]]
As an international coalition under United States command assembled in anticipation of an invasion of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, the Iraqi regime decided to destroy as much of Kuwait's oil reserves and infrastructure as possible before withdrawing from that country. As early as December 1990, Iraqi forces placed explosive charges on Kuwaiti oil wells. The wells were systematically sabotaged beginning on January 16, 1991, when the allies commenced air strikes against Iraqi targets. On February 8, satellite images detected the first smoke from burning oil wells. The number of oil fires peaked between February 22 and 24, when the allied ground offensive began.&lt;ref name="DoD EER"&gt;[[United States Department of Defense]] ''Environmental Exposure Report: Oil Well Fires'' (updated August 2, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]'s report to [[United States Congress|Congress]], "the retreating Iraqi army set fire to or damaged over 700 oil wells, storage tanks, refineries, and facilities in Kuwait."&lt;ref name="1991 EPA Report"&gt;[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (1991). [http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/20014FNJ.txt?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=1991%20Thru%201994&amp;File=D%3A%5CZYFILES%5CINDEX%20DATA%5C91THRU94%5CTXT%5C00000017%5C20014FNJ.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;Display=p%7Cf&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1 "Report to Congress: United States Gulf Environmental Technical Assistance"], pp. 14, A-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates placed the number of oil well fires from 605 to 732. A further thirty-four wells had been destroyed by heavy coalition bombing in January.&lt;ref name="DoD EER"/&gt; The Kuwait Petroleum Company's estimate as of September 1991 was that there had been 610 fires, out of a total of 749 facilities damaged or on fire along with an unspecified number of oil filled low-lying areas, such as "oil lakes" and "fire [[trench]]es".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; These fires constituted approximately 50% of the total number of oil well fires in the [[history of the petroleum industry]],&lt;ref name="1991 EPA Report"/&gt; and temporarily damaged or destroyed approximately 85% of the wells in every major Kuwaiti oil field.&lt;ref name="DoD EER"/&gt;

Concerted efforts to bring the fires and other damage under control began in April 1991. During the uncontrolled burning phase from February to April,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/owf_ii/fig28.htm |title=Figure 28. Kuwait oil well capping, extinguishing, and oil flow chronology}}&lt;/ref&gt; various sources estimated that the ignited wellheads burnt through between four and six million [[barrel of oil|barrels of crude oil]], and between seventy and one hundred million [[cubic meters|cubic meters of natural gas]] per day.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthshots.usgs.gov/Iraq/Iraqtext |title="Iraq and Kuwait: 1972, 1990, 1991, 1997."

==Military effects==
[[File:USAF F-16A F-15C F-15E Desert Storm edit2.jpg|thumb|right|[[United States Air Force|USAF]] aircraft fly over burning Kuwaiti oil wells (1991)]]
[[File:BrennendeOelquellenKuwait1991.jpg|thumb|right|The oil fires caused a dramatic decrease in [[air quality]], causing [[respiratory]] problems for many soldiers on the ground without [[gas masks]] (1991).]]
[[File:B Company, 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines at Al-Burgan Oil Field, Kuwait in Gulf War, February 1991.tif|thumb|right|United States Marines approach burning oilfields during ground war of the Gulf War (1991).]]

On March 21, 1991, a Royal Saudi Air Force [[C-130]]H crashed in heavy smoke due to the Kuwaiti oil fires on approach to [[Ras Mishab Airport]], [[Saudi Arabia]]. 92 Senegalese soldiers and 6 Saudi crew members were killed, the largest accident among Coalition forces.&lt;ref name="92-senegalese-soldiers-die"&gt;Schmitt, Eric (March 22, 1991). [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/22/world/after-the-war-92-senegalese-soldiers-die-in-saudi-arabia-air-crash.html "After the War"]. ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The smoke screening was also used by Iraqi anti-armor forces to a successful extent in the [[Battle of Phase Line Bullet]], having aided in achieving the element of surprise against advancing [[M2 Bradley|Bradley (IFV)]]s, along with increasing the general [[fog of war]].

The fires burned out of control because of the dangers of sending in firefighting crews during the war. [[Land mines]] had been placed in areas around the oil wells and military [[demining]] was necessary before the fires could be put out. Around {{convert|5|Moilbbl|m3|-4}} of oil were lost each day. Eventually, privately contracted crews extinguished the fires, at a total cost of [[US$]]1.5 billion to Kuwait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Husain |first=T. |title=Kuwaiti Oil Fires: Regional Environmental Perspectives |year=1995 |publisher=BPC Wheatons Ltd |location=[[Oxford]] |pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, however, the fires had burned for approximately ten months, causing widespread pollution.

The fires have been linked with what was later deemed [[Gulf War Syndrome]], a chronic disorder afflicting military veterans and civilian workers that include fatigue, muscle pain, and cognitive problems; however, studies have indicated that the firemen who capped the wells did not report any of the symptoms that the soldiers experienced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/syndrome/analysis/oilwell.html Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses: Final Report], December 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The causes of Gulf War Syndrome have yet to be been determined.

From the perspective of ground forces, apart from the occasional "oil rain" experienced by troops very close to spewing wells,&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/owf_ii/owf_ii_s05.htm#D.%20Possible%20Health%20Effects%20of%20Oil%20Fires |title=Possible Health effects of Oil fires}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the more commonly experienced effects of the oil field fires were the ensuing smoke [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]]s which rose into the atmosphere and then [[Precipitation|precipitated]] or fell out of the air via [[dry deposition]] and by rain. The pillar-like plumes frequently broadened and joined up with other smoke plumes at higher altitudes, producing a cloudy grey [[overcast]] effect, as only about 10% of all the fires corresponding with those that originated from "oil lakes" produced pure black [[soot]] filled plumes, 25% of the fires emitted white to grey plumes, while the remainder emitted plumes with colors between grey and black.&lt;ref name="gulflink.osd.mil"/&gt; For example, one Gulf War veteran stated:&lt;ref name="gulflink.osd.mil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAB J – Plume Configurations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

{{quote|It was like a cloudy day all day long, in fact, we didn’t realize it was smoke at first. The smoke was about 500 feet above us, so we couldn’t see the sky. However, we could see horizontally for long distances with no problem. We knew it was smoke when the mucous from our nostrils started to look [[soot|black]]..."}}

A paper published in 2000 analyzed the degree of exposure by troops to [[particulate matter]], which included soot but the paper focused more-so on [[silica]] sand, which can produce [[silicosis]]. The paper included troop medical records,&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA382643 |title=Particulate Exposure During The Persian Gulf War B. R Thomas 2000. PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6l2EB0RiJ?url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA382643 |archivedate=October 5, 2016 |accessdate=October 5, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in its conclusion: "A literature review indicated negligible to nonexistent health risk from other inhaled particulate material (other than silica) during the Gulf War".

==Extinguishing efforts==
{{see also|Oil well fire}}
The burning wells needed to be extinguished as, without active efforts, Kuwait would lose billions of dollars in oil revenues. It was predicted that the fires would burn from two to five years before losing pressure and going out on their own, optimists estimating two years and pessimists estimating five while the majority estimated three years until this occurred.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOkWEN6kfy4 Betchel corporation ''Kuwait: Bringing Back the Sun'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The companies responsible for [[oil well fire|extinguishing the fires]] initially were [[Bechtel]], [[Red Adair]] Company (now sold off to [[Global Industries]] of [[Louisiana]]), [[Boots and Coots]], and [[Wild Well Control]]. [[Safety Boss]] was the fourth company to arrive but ended up extinguishing and capping the most wells of any other company: 180 of the 600. Other companies including Cudd Well/Pressure Control, Neal Adams Firefighters, and Kuwait Wild Well Killers were also contracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bechtel.com/projects/kuwait-reconstruction/|title=See how the Kuwait Oil Fields were Restored|work=Bechtel Corporate|access-date=2017-07-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Larry H. Flak, a petroleum engineer for Boots and Coots International Well Control, 90% of all the 1991 fires in Kuwait were put out with nothing but sea water, sprayed from powerful hoses at the base of the fire.&lt;ref name="sptimes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/03/21/Worldandnation/Fires_erupt_in_large_.shtml |title= Iraq Fires erupt in large Iraqi oil field in south Compiled from Times wires © St. Petersburg Times published March 21, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extinguishing water was supplied to the arid desert region by re-purposing the [[oil pipeline]]s that prior to the arson attack had pumped oil from the wells to the [[Persian Gulf]].  The pipeline had been mildly damaged but, once repaired, its flow was reversed to pump Persian gulf [[seawater]] to the burning oil wells.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOkWEN6kfy4 Betchel corporation ''Kuwait: Bringing Back the Sun'', animation sequence]&lt;/ref&gt; The extinguishing rate was approximately 1 every 7–10 days at the start of efforts but then with experience gained and the removal of the [[mine fields]] that surrounded the burning wells, the rate increased to 2 or more per day.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

For stubborn [[oil well fire]]s, the use of a [[gas turbine]] to blast a large volume of water at high velocity at the fire proved popular with firefighters in Kuwait and was brought to the region by Hungarians equipped with [[MiG-21]] engines mounted originally on a [[T-34]] (later replaced with [[T-55]]) tank, called [[Big wind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/owf_ii/owf_ii_tabc.htm |title=TAB C – Fighting the Oil Well Fires}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/stilling-the-fires-of-war-big-wind-page-2 |title=Stilling The Fires of War, A Hungarian company lashes two MiG engines to a Soviet tank and proceeds to huff and puff and blow out the worst sort of raging oil-well fire. 2001. page 2, story by ZOLTAN SCRIVENER}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Husain, T., Kuwaiti Oil Fires: Regional Environmental Perspectives, 1st ed. Oxford, UK:BPC Wheatons Ltd, 1995, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; It extinguished 9 fires in 43 days.

In fighting a fire at a directly vertical spewing [[wellhead]], [[high explosive]]s, such as [[dynamite]] were used to create a [[blast wave]] that pushes the burning fuel and local atmospheric oxygen away from the well. (This is a similar principle to blowing out a candle.) The flame is removed and the fuel can continue to spill out without igniting. Generally, explosives were placed within [[55 gallon drum]]s, the explosives surrounded by [[fire retardant]] chemicals, and then the drums are wrapped with insulating material with a horizontal crane being used to bring the drum as close to the burning area as possible.&lt;ref name="sptimes.com"/&gt;

The firefighting teams titled their occupation as "Operation Desert Hell" after [[Operation Desert Storm]].&lt;ref name="iadc.org"&gt;http://www.iadc.org/dcpi/dc-novdec03/Nov3-Boots.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fire documentaries===
The fires were the subject of a 1992 [[IMAX]] [[documentary film]], ''[[Fires of Kuwait]]'', which was nominated for an [[Academy Award]]. The film includes footage of the Hungarian team using their jet turbine extinguisher.

[[Lessons of Darkness]] is a 1992 film by director [[Werner Herzog]] that explores of the ravaged oil fields of post-Gulf War Kuwait.

Betchel Corporation produced a short documentary titled ''Kuwait: Bringing Back the Sun'' that summarizes and focuses upon the fire fighting efforts, which were dubbed the Al-Awda ([[Arabic]] for "The Return") project.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kockw.com"&gt;http://www.kockw.com/sites/EN/Pages/Profile/History/OilFires.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==

===Oil fire smoke===
{{see also|Nuclear winter#Kuwait wells in the first Gulf War}}
[[File:Kuwait burn oilfield.png|thumb|left|An oilfield on fire (1991)]]
Immediately following Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, predictions were made of an environmental disaster stemming from Iraqi threats to blow up captured Kuwaiti oil wells. Speculation ranging from a [[nuclear winter]] type scenario, to heavy [[acid rain]] and even short term immediate [[global warming]] were presented at the [[World Climate Conference]] in Geneva that November.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.kfupm.edu.sa/6551/1/6551_1.pdf KUWAITI OIL FIRES - MODELING REVISITED]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmington morning Star"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6tEVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RBQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6851,2148654&amp;dq=world-climate-conference+oil+fires&amp;hl=en Wilmington morning Star] January 21’st, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 10, 1991, a paper appearing in the Journal ''Nature'', stated [[Paul Crutzen]]'s calculations that the setting alight of the Kuwait oil wells would produce a "[[nuclear winter]]", with a cloud of smoke covering half of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] after 100 days had passed and beneath the cloud, temperatures would be reduced by 5-10 Celsius.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v349/n6305/pdf/349096a0.pdf |title=Oil-well climate catastrophe |first=Peter |last=Aldhous |journal=Nature |volume=349 |issue=6305 |page=96 |date=January 10, 1991 |doi=10.1038/349096a0 |quote=The fears expressed last week centred around the cloud of soot that would result if Kuwait’s oil wells were set alight by Iraqi forces ... with effects similar to those of the "nuclear winter" ...

Crutzen ... estimates that temperatures beneath such a cloud could be reduced by 5-10 degrees C|bibcode=1991Natur.349...96A }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by articles printed in the [[Star-News|Wilmington morning star]] and the [[The Baltimore Sun|Baltimore Sun]] newspapers in mid to late January 1991, with the popular TV scientist personality of the time, [[Carl Sagan]], who was also the co-author of the first few [[nuclear winter]] papers along with [[Richard P. Turco]], John W. Birks, [[Alan Robock]] and [[Paul Crutzen]] together collectively stated that they expected catastrophic [[nuclear winter]] like effects with continental sized impacts of "sub-freezing" temperatures as a result if the Iraqis went through with their threats of igniting 300 to 500 pressurized oil wells and they burned for a few months.&lt;ref name="articles.baltimoresun.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmington morning Star"/&gt;

Later when [[Operation Desert Storm]] had begun, Dr. [[S. Fred Singer]] and [[Carl Sagan]] discussed the possible environmental impacts of the Kuwaiti petroleum fires on the [[ABC News]] program ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]''. Sagan again argued that some of the effects of the smoke could be similar to the effects of a [[nuclear winter]], with smoke lofting into the [[stratosphere]], a region of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] beginning around {{convert|43000|ft|m}} above sea level at Kuwait,&lt;ref&gt;ftp://ftp.atmos.washington.edu/debbie/UAE-Award/Enc11-Reprints-Hobbs-etal-Cloud-Active-Nuclei/05-HobbsRadke-1992-Science-v256-987.pdf{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in global effects and that he believed the net effects would be very similar to the explosion of the Indonesian volcano [[Mount Tambora|Tambora]] in 1815, which resulted in the year 1816 being known as the ''[[Year Without a Summer]]''.

He reported on initial modeling estimates that forecast impacts extending to south Asia, and perhaps to the northern hemisphere as well. Singer, on the other hand, said that calculations showed that the smoke would go to an altitude of about {{convert|3000|ft|m}} and then be rained out after about three to five days and thus the lifetime of the smoke would be limited. Both height estimates made by Singer and Sagan turned out to be wrong, albeit with Singer's narrative being closer to what transpired, with the comparatively minimal atmospheric effects remaining limited to the Persian Gulf region, with smoke plumes, in general,&lt;ref name="gulflink.osd.mil"/&gt; lofting to about {{convert|10,000|ft|m}} and a few times as high as {{convert|20,000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/4960296/The-Kuwaiti-Oli-Fires|title=The Kuwaiti Oil Fires|author=Hirschmann, Kris|publisher=Facts on File.|access-date=2017-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193647/http://www.scribd.com/doc/4960296/The-Kuwaiti-Oli-Fires|archive-date=2014-01-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--The reference for this is a hardcopy transcript of the episode, excerpts on the Fred Singer talk page.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

Along with Singer's televised critique, Richard D. Small criticized the initial ''Nature'' paper in a reply on March 7, 1991 arguing along similar lines as Singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v350/n6313/pdf/350011a0.pdf |title=Environmental impact of fires in Kuwait |first= Richard D. |last=Small |others=[[Pacific-Sierra Research Corporation]] |journal=Nature |volume=350 |issue=6313 |pages=11–12 |date=March 7, 1991 |doi=10.1038/350011a0 |quote=16,000 metric tons of actual soot is produced from 220,000 metric tons of oil burned every day. ‘My estimates of the smoke produced by destruction of Kuwait’s oil wells and refineries and the smoke stabilization altitude do not support any of the purported impacts. '''The smoke is not injected high enough to spread over large areas of the Northern Hemisphere,''' nor is enough produced to cause a measurable temperature change or failure of the monsoons.|bibcode=1991Natur.350...11S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan later conceded in his book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' that his prediction did not turn out to be correct: "it ''was'' pitch black at noon and temperatures dropped 4–6&amp;nbsp;°C over the Persian Gulf, but not much smoke reached stratospheric altitudes and Asia was spared."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sagan, Carl |title=The demon-haunted world: science as a candle in the dark |publisher=Random House |location=New York |year=1996 |page=257 |isbn=978-0-394-53512-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the peak of the fires, the smoke absorbed 75 to 80% of the sun’s radiation. The particles rose to a maximum of {{convert|20,000|ft|m}}, but were [[scavenger (chemistry)|scavenged]] by [[cloud condensation nuclei]] from the atmosphere relatively quickly.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;[ftp://ftp.atmos.washington.edu/debbie/UAE-Award/Enc11-Reprints-Hobbs-etal-Cloud-Active-Nuclei/05-HobbsRadke-1992-Science-v256-987.pdf Airborne Studies of the Smoke from the Kuwait Oil Fires Hobbs, Peter V; Radke, Lawrence F Science; May 15, 1992; 256,5059]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Peter V. |last1=Hobbs |first2=Lawrence F. |last2=Radke |title=Airborne Studies of the Smoke from the Kuwait Oil Fires |journal=Science |date=May 15, 1992 |doi= 10.1126/science.256.5059.987 |volume=256 |issue=5059 |pages=987–91 |pmid=17795001 |bibcode = 1992Sci...256..987H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan and his colleagues expected that a "self-lofting" of the sooty smoke would occur when it absorbed the sun's heat radiation, with little to no scavenging occurring, whereby the black particles of soot would be heated by the sun and lifted/lofted higher and higher into the air, thereby injecting the soot into the stratosphere where it would take years for the sun blocking effect of this [[aerosol]] of soot to fall out of the air, and with that, catastrophic ground level cooling and agricultural impacts in Asia and possibly the [[Northern Hemisphere]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-01-23/news/1991023131_1_kuwait-saddam-hussein-sagan |title= PAGE 2 of 2: Burning oil wells could be disaster, Sagan says January 23, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In retrospect, it is now known that smoke from the Kuwait oil fires only affected the weather pattern throughout the Persian Gulf and surrounding region during the periods that the fires were burning in 1991, with lower atmospheric winds blowing the smoke along the eastern half of the Arabian Peninsula, and cities such as [[Dhahran]] and [[Riyadh]], and countries such as [[Bahrain]] experienced days with smoke filled skies and carbon [[soot]] rainout/fallout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Meteorological Effects of the Kuwait Oil Fires | url=http://as.wm.edu/Abstracts/PatrickDowling.pdf | author=Patrick K. Dowling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus the immediate consequence of the arson sabotage was a dramatic regional decrease in [[air quality]], causing respiratory problems for many Kuwaitis and those in neighboring countries.

According to the 1992 study from [[Peter V. Hobbs|Peter Hobbs]] and Lawrence Radke, daily emissions of [[sulfur dioxide]] (which can generate [[acid rain]]) from the Kuwaiti oil fires were 57% of that from electric utilities in the United States, the emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] were 2% of global emissions and emissions of [[soot]] reached 3400 metric tons per day.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In a paper in the [[DTIC]] archive, published in 2000, it states that "Calculations based on smoke from Kuwaiti oil fires in May and June 1991 indicate that [[stoichiometry|combustion efficiency]] was about 96% in producing [[carbon dioxide]]. While, with respect to the incomplete combustion fraction, Smoke [[particulate matter]] accounted for 2% of the fuel burned, of which 0.4% was soot."[With the remaining 2%, being oil that did not undergo any initial combustion].&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

===Smoke documentary===
Peter V. Hobbs also narrated a short amateur documentary titled ''Kuwait Oil Fires'' that followed the [[University of Washington]]/UW's "Cloud and Aerosol Research Group" as they flew through, around and above the smoke clouds and took samples, measurements, and video of the smoke clouds in their [[Convair C-131]](N327UW&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.net/search/photo.search?regsearch=N327UW|title=Photo Search Results|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Aerial laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CXvz9G1gjw|title=Kuwait Oil Fires|date=January 23, 2012|work=YouTube|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil spills==

Forty-six oil wells are estimated to have gushed,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and before efforts to cap them began, they were releasing approximately 300,000-400,000 barrels of oil per day, with the last [[oil gusher|gusher]] being capped occurring in the latter days of October 1991.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The Kuwaiti Oil Minister estimated between twenty-five and fifty million barrels of unburned oil from damaged facilities pooled to create approximately 300 oil lakes, that contaminated around 40 million tons of sand and earth. The mixture of desert sand, unignited oil spilled and [[soot]] generated by the burning oil wells formed layers of hard "tarcrete", which covered nearly five percent of Kuwait's land mass.&lt;ref&gt;[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] News, [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2003/0321kuwaitfire.html ''1991 Kuwait Oil Fires''], March 21, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleaning efforts were led by the [[Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research]] and the Arab Oil Co., who tested a number of technologies including the use of [[petroleum-degrading bacteria]] on the oil lakes.&lt;ref name="HMM" /&gt;

Vegetation in most of the contaminated areas adjoining the oil lakes began recovering by 1995, but the dry climate has also partially solidified some of the lakes.

The land based Kuwaiti oil spill surpassed the [[Lakeview Gusher]], which spilled nine million pounds in 1910, as the largest oil spill in recorded history.

Six to eight million barrels of oil were directly spilled into the Persian Gulf, which became known as the [[Gulf War oil spill]].&lt;ref name="1991 EPA Report"/&gt;

The '''Semipalatinsk Test Site''' (STS or Semipalatinsk-21), also known as "The Polygon", was the primary testing venue for the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[nuclear weapons]]. It is located on the [[steppe]] in northeast [[Kazakhstan]] (then the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]]), south of the valley of the [[Irtysh River]]. The scientific buildings for the test site were located around {{convert|150|km|abbr=on}} west of the town of [[Semey|Semipalatinsk]] (later renamed Semey), near the border of [[East Kazakhstan Region]] and [[Pavlodar Region]] with most of the nuclear tests taking place at various sites further to the west and south, some as far as into [[Karagandy Region]].

The Soviet Union conducted 456 nuclear tests at Semipalatinsk from 1949 until 1989 with little regard for their effect on the local people or environment. The full impact of radiation exposure was hidden for many years by Soviet authorities and has only come to light since the test site closed in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Slow Death In Kazakhstan's Land Of Nuclear Tests|url = http://www.rferl.org/content/soviet_nuclear_testing_semipalatinsk_20th_anniversary/24311518.html|newspaper = RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|date = 2011-08-29|access-date = 2015-08-31|language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was selected in 1947 by [[Lavrentiy Beria]], political head of the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]] (Beria falsely claimed the vast 18,000&amp;nbsp;km² steppe was "uninhabited").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kazakhstan|first=Paul|last=Brummell|publisher=Bradt|year=2008|isbn=978-1-84162-234-7|page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The world's worst radiation hotspot|first=Jerome|last=Taylor|date=10 September 2009|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=21 July 2011|location=London|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-worlds-worst-radiation-hotspot-1784502.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gulag]] labour was employed to build the primitive test facilities, including the laboratory complex in the northeast corner on the southern bank of the Irtysh River.  The first Soviet bomb test, [[Operation First Lightning]] (nicknamed ''Joe One'' by the Americans) was conducted in 1949 from a tower at the Semipalatinsk Test Site, scattering [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] on nearby villages (which Beria had neglected to evacuate).{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The same area ("the experimental field", a region {{convert|40|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} west of Kurchatov city) was used for more than 100 subsequent above-ground weapons tests.

Later tests were moved to the Chagan River complex and nearby Balapan in the east of the STS (including the site of the [[Chagan (nuclear test)|Chagan test]], which formed [[Chagan Lake (Kazakhstan)|Chagan Lake]]). Once atmospheric tests were banned, testing was transferred to underground locations at Chagan, Murzhik (in the west), and at the [[Degelen Mountain]] complex in the south, which is riddled with boreholes and drifts for both subcritical and supercritical tests. After the closure of the Semipalatinsk labour camp, construction duties were performed by the 217th Separate Engineering and Mining Battalion (who later built the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]]). Between 1949 and the cessation of atomic testing in 1989, 456 explosions were conducted at the STS, including 340 underground (borehole and tunnel) shots and 116 atmospheric (either air-drop or tower shots). The lab complex, still the administrative and scientific centre of the STS, was renamed [[Kurchatov, Kazakhstan|Kurchatov]] City after [[Igor Kurchatov]], leader of the initial Soviet nuclear programme. The location of Kurchatov city has been typically shown on various
maps as "Konechnaya" (the name of the train station; now Degelen) or "Moldary" (the name of the village that was later incorporated into the city).

The Semipalatinsk Complex was of acute interest to foreign governments during its operation, particularly during the phase when explosions were carried out above ground at the experimental field. Several [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] overflights examined preparations and weapons effects, before being replaced with satellite reconnaissance. The US [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] is said to have been convinced that the Soviets had constructed an enormous [[beam weapon]] station at a small research station located on the testing site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/mp_sovi_pop.html "Satellite photo of suspected Soviet beam weapon installation"], ''Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology'' (via PBS)&lt;/ref&gt;  This smaller research station, known to the Department of Defense as PNUTS (Possible Nuclear Underground Test Site) and the CIA as URDF-3 (Unidentified Research and Development Facility-3) was of great interest to American observers. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, it was discovered that the mysterious URDF-3 was tasked with researching a [[nuclear thermal rocket]] similar to the US's [[NERVA]].&lt;ref&gt;Richelson, Jefferey, ''The Wizards of Langley'' Westview Press, New York, NY 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was officially closed by the [[President of Kazakhstan]] [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] on 29 August 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norris|first=Robert S.|jstor=23624674|title=The Soviet Nuclear Archipelago|date=January–February 1992|journal=Arms Control Today|publisher=Arms Control Association|volume=22|issue=1|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
The Soviet Union conducted its last tests in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duff-Brown|first=Beth|title=The lasting toll of Semipalatinsk's nuclear testing|url=http://thebulletin.org/lasting-toll-semipalatinsks-nuclear-testing|publisher=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the site was neglected. Unguarded fissile material was left behind in mountain tunnels and bore holes, virtually unguarded and vulnerable to scavengers, rogue states, or potential terrorists. The secret cleanup of Semipalatinsk was made public in the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duff-Brown|first=Beth|title=Into Thin Air: The Story of Plutonium Mountain|url=http://thebulletin.org/thin-air-story-plutonium-mountain|publisher=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After some of the tests, radioactive material remained on the now abandoned area, including significant amounts of plutonium. The risk that material might fall into the hands of scavengers or terrorists was considered one of the largest nuclear security threats since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The operation to address the problem involved, in part, pouring special concrete into test holes, to bind the waste plutonium. In other cases, horizontal mine test holes were sealed and the entrances covered over. Finally in October 2012, Kazakh, Russian, and American nuclear scientists and engineers celebrated the completion of a secret 17-year, $150 million operation to secure the plutonium in the tunnels of the mountains.&lt;ref name="belfer" /&gt;

Large parts of the STS have opened up since 2014, and economic activity has resumed: mostly mining, but also agriculture and tourism. Like other areas affected by radioactivity, the lack of human interference has made the STS a haven for wildlife.&lt;ref name="caravanistan.com"/&gt;

==Anti-nuclear movement==
The [[anti-nuclear movement in Kazakhstan]], "Nevada Semipalatinsk", was formed in 1989 and was one of the first major [[anti-nuclear movement]]s in the former [[Soviet Union]].  It was led by author [[Olzhas Suleimenov]] and attracted thousands of people to its protests and campaigns which eventually led to the closure of the [[nuclear test site]] at [[Semipalatinsk]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="bbc1999"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/288008.stm World: Asia-Pacific: Kazakh anti-nuclear movement celebrates tenth anniversary] ''BBC News'', February 28, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chance"&gt;Matthew Chance.

According to [[UNESCO]], Nevada-Semipalatinsk played a positive role in promoting public understanding of "the necessity to fight against nuclear threats".&lt;ref name="un"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=16406&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Kazakhstan - Audiovisual documents of the International antinuclear movement “Nevada-Semipalatinsk”|website=Portal.unesco.org|accessdate=18 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement gained global support and became "a real historical factor in finding solutions to global ecological problems".&lt;ref name="un" /&gt;

==Health impacts==
Studies conducted at Cambridge took blood samples from forty different families who lived in a district of [[Kazakhstan]] that were directly exposed at high levels to fallout from the Soviet bomb tests.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauer|first=Susanne|last2=Gusev|first2=Boris I.|last3=Pivina|first3=Ludmila M.|last4=Apsalikov|first4=Kazbek N.|last5=Grosche|first5=Bernd|date=2005-01-01|title=Radiation Exposure Due to Local Fallout from Soviet Atmospheric Nuclear Weapons Testing in Kazakhstan: Solid Cancer Mortality in the Semipalatinsk Historical Cohort, 1960-1999|jstor=3581526|journal=Radiation Research|volume=164|issue=4|pages=409–419|doi=10.1667/rr3423.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies concluded that individuals who had been exposed to the fallout between 1949 and 1956 had an approximate 80% increase in the [[Minisatellite]] regions of their [[DNA]]. The children of these individuals had 50% more mutations in their mini-satellite regions compared to their control counterparts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3076055|title=DNA Mutations Linked to Soviet Bomb Tests|last=Stone|first=Richard|date=|website=Jstor.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some health scientists are still not sure what the [[germline mutation]]s mean for the individuals' health, but there is increasing evidence these mutations may increase genetic predisposition to certain diseases such as [[cardiovascular disease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grosche|first=Bernd|last2=Lackland|first2=Daniel T.|last3=Land|first3=Charles E.|last4=Simon|first4=Steven L.|last5=Apsalikov|first5=Kazbek N.|last6=Pivina|first6=Ludmilla M.|last7=Bauer|first7=Susanne|last8=Gusev|first8=Boris I.|date=2011-01-01|title=Mortality from Cardiovascular Diseases in the Semipalatinsk Historical Cohort, 1960-1999, and its Relationship to Radiation Exposure|jstor=41318233|journal=Radiation Research|volume=176|issue=5|pages=660–669|doi=10.1667/rr2211.1|pmc=3866702}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There has also been evidence that increased levels of DNA mutation rates are correlated with prolonged 
[[radiation exposure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dubrova|first=Yuri E.|last2=Bersimbaev|first2=Rakhmet I.|last3=Djansugurova|first3=Leila B.|last4=Tankimanova|first4=Maira K.|last5=Mamyrbaeva|first5=Zaure Zh.|last6=Mustonen|first6=Riitta|last7=Lindholm|first7=Carita|last8=Hultén|first8=Maj|last9=Salomaa|first9=Sisko|date=2002-01-01|title=Nuclear Weapons Tests and Human Germline Mutation Rate|jstor=3076101|journal=Science|volume=295|issue=5557|pages=1037–1037|doi=10.1126/science.1068102}}&lt;/ref&gt; A longitudinal study conducted over a 40-year span found a correlation between radiation fallout exposure and prevalence of solid tumors. The most frequent sites for solid tumors were the esophagus, stomach, lungs, breasts, and liver. These sites were found to have statistically significant increases in prevalence when compared to a control group. However some bodily sites had no significant difference in number: [[Cervix|cervix uteri]], [[kidney]], [[rectum]], and [[pancreas]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study's data suggests that there is a link between exposure length, and amount, to overall and cancer mortality. Nonetheless the relationship between the level of radiation exposure and effect is still up for discussion.

The full impact of radiation exposure was hidden for many years by Soviet authorities. The general consensus of health studies conducted at the site since it was closed is that radioactive fallout from nuclear testing had a direct impact on the health of about 200,000 local residents. Specifically, scientists have linked higher rates of different types of cancer to post-irradiation effects.  Likewise, several studies have explored the correlation between radiation exposure and thyroid abnormalities.&lt;ref name="Kassenova"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/the-lasting-toll-of-semipalatinsks-nuclear-testing |title=The lasting toll of Semipalatinsk's nuclear testing |author=Togzhan Kassenova |date=28 September 2009 |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[BBC]] program claimed in 2010 that in the worst affected locations one in 20 children born were with genetic defects. British film-maker [[Antony Butts]] documented some of the genetic health impacts in his 2010 film ''After the Apocalypse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life after nuclear testing|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/programmes/2010/11/101119_kazakhstan_nuclear_testing.shtml|website=BBC World Service|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Butts|first1=Antony|title=After the Apocalypse|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1825646/|date=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recently-declassified CIA report provides a first-hand witness account of the immediate impacts of a nuclear test near Semipalatinsk in 1955. In this report, a source who was in the vicinity of a Soviet thermonuclear test in November 1955 describes experiencing loss of hearing, "the air...crackling up with pressure" as if the "air was tearing up," and the ground shaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burr|first=William|title=CIA Debriefed Soviet H-Bomb Eye-Witness in 1957|url=https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/nuclear-vault/2018-04-06/cia-debriefed-soviet-h-bomb-eye-witness-1957|date=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//dc.html?doc=4430809-Document-03-Central-Intelligence-Agency|title=The National Security Archive|website=Nsarchive2.gwu.edu|accessdate=18 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site of the signing of the Central Asian Nuclear Weapon Free Zone treaty==
Semipalatinsk was the site that [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]] chose for the signing of the [[Central Asian Nuclear Weapon Free Zone]] on 8 September 2006, also commemorating the 15th anniversary of the test site's closing.

==In popular culture==
The 2014 film [[Ispytanie (film)|Ispytanie]] is a fictionalized account of the first Soviet nuclear test from the perspective of some of the local inhabitants.

[[File:2014 Israeli oil spill in Evrona nature reserve (1).jpg|thumbnail|2014 Israeli oil spill in Evrona nature reserve]]
In December 2014, a '''major oil spill''' occurred in the vicinity of [[Be'er Ora]] Israel,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4600972,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; with an estimated 3-5 million liters&lt;ref name="oil3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/10/us-israel-oil-spill-idUSKBN0JO10F20141210|title=Clean-up of Israeli desert oil spill could take years: experts}}&lt;/ref&gt; of crude oil leaking from a breached pipeline, contaminating much of the [[Evrona nature reserve]]. An [[Ministry of Environmental Protection (Israel)|Environmental Protection Ministry]] official stated that the cleanup would likely take years, and that the spill was one of the gravest natural disasters in the country's history.&lt;ref name="oil1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-oil-spill-600-000-gallons-lost-eilat-pipeline-breach-n261386|title=Israel Oil Spill: 600,000-Gallons Lost in Eilat Pipeline Breach}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oil2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/12/04/israel-oil-spill-idUKL6N0TO20X20141204|title=UPDATE 1-Oil spill floods into Israeli nature reserve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of this, On December 9, 2014, [[Ofir Akunis]] was appointed deputy environmental protection minister. Akunis replaced [[Amir Peretz]], who resigned from his post at the helm of the ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sviva.gov.il/English/AboutUs/Minister/Pages/default-minister.aspx|title=Minister|work=sviva.gov.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment, by Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s office, came a week after the massive crude oil spill in Israel's Arava region. Akunis said that "it is the deputy minister's intention to prioritize treatment of the ecological disaster in the south and to do all that is necessary to prevent the spread of the crude oil, and to prevent a health and environmental disaster."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sviva.gov.il/English/ResourcesandServices/NewsAndEvents/NewsAndMessageDover/Pages/2014/y%20December/Ophir-Akunis-Appointed-Deputy-Environmental-Protection-Minister.aspx|title=Ofir Akunis Appointed Deputy Environmental Protection Minister|work=sviva.gov.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akunis ordered crews to raise the side walls of the dams that had been built in the [[Arabah|Arava]] to prevent flooding. Thanks to the infrastructure that had already been built in the area, the risk that the oil would reach the [[Gulf of Eilat]] significantly dropped. Akunis instructed that the reserve remain closed as long as high values of pollutants were still registered in air quality tests.

In the end of December 2014, the government approved a [[New Israeli Shekel|NIS]] 17 million Environmental Protection Ministry plan to rehabilitate. According to Akunis, the NIS 17 million program will serve to treat the soils contaminated by the spill as well as help restore the wildlife populations damaged over the course of the event. As part of the plan, a special team will be appointed to evaluate the environmental impact of various [[Eilat Ashkelon Pipeline Company]] activities on both dry land and beaches. The approved plan also involves opening a closed Eilat beach on EAPC-owned property to the city's residents and visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kristinelmingforum.net/government-approves-nis-17-million-fund-for-arava-oil-spill-rehabilitation/|title=Government approves NIS 17 million fund for Arava oil spill rehabilitation «  Pacific Piano Performance Posts|work=kristinelmingforum.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, air quality tests found that there had been a 90% reduction of pollution in Evrona.

The '''2013 Southeast Asian haze''' was a [[haze]] crisis that affected several countries in [[Southeast Asia]], including [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haze in Singapore hits PSI all-time record high of 371|url=http://sg.news.yahoo.com/haze-reaches--unhealthy--level-in-singapore-085448213.html|publisher=Yahoo! News|accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Southern Thailand]], mainly during June and July 2013. The haze period was caused by large-scale burning in many parts of [[Sumatra]] and [[Borneo]]. [[Satellite imagery]] from [[NASA]]'s Terra and Aqua satellites showed that the haze was mainly due to smoke from fires burning in [[Riau]] province, Indonesia.&lt;ref name="Smoke Engulfs Singapore"&gt;{{cite web|title=Smoke Engulfs Singapore|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=81431|publisher=NASA Earth Observatory|date=21 June 2013|accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 Southeast Asian haze was notable for causing record high levels of pollution in Singapore and several parts of Malaysia. The 3-hour [[Pollutant Standards Index|Pollution Standards Index]] in Singapore reached a record high of 401 on 21 June 2013, surpassing the previous record of 226 set during the [[1997 Southeast Asian Haze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore haze hits record high from Indonesia fires|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22998592|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 June, the [[Air Pollution Index|Air Pollution Index (API)]] in Muar, Johor spiked to 746 at 7 a.m. which was almost 2.5 times above the minimum range of the ''Hazardous'' level thus resulting in the declaration of emergency in Muar and Ledang (which was afterwards lifted on 25 June in the morning), leaving the towns in virtual shutdown.&lt;ref name="Channel News Asia"&gt;{{cite news|title=Malaysia declares state of emergency in Muar and Ledang|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/malaysia-declares-state/721254.html|publisher=Channel News Asia|date=23 June 2013|accessdate=23 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626025209/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/malaysia-declares-state/721254.html|archivedate=26 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thestar1"&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2013/6/25/nation/20130625111851&amp;sec=nation "Haze: State of emergency lifted in Muar and Ledang, schools reopen"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630043207/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2013%2F6%2F25%2Fnation%2F20130625111851&amp;sec=nation |date=30 June 2013 }}, ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'', Malaysia. 25 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 June 2013, [[NASA]]'s Terra and Aqua satellites captured images of smoke from illegal [[wildfire]]s on the Indonesian island of Sumatra blowing east toward southern Malaysia and Singapore, causing thick clouds of [[haze]] in the region.&lt;ref name="Smoke Engulfs Singapore"/&gt; As stated by a local Indonesian official, the source of the haze might be a 3,000 hectare [[peatland]] in [[Bengkalis Regency]], [[Riau|Riau Province]], which was set ablaze by an unknown party on 9 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Haze source 'may be' fire on Riau land parcel 4 times size of Ang Mo Kio|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/the-big-story/the-haze-singapore/story/haze-source-may-be-fire-riau-land-parcel-4-times-size-ang-mo-|accessdate=21 June 2013|website=The Straits Times|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many as 187 hotspots were picked up by satellites on 18 June,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Four times as many hotspots in Sumatra now|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2013/6/19/nation/13257164&amp;sec=nation|accessdate=19 June 2013|newspaper=The Star|date=19 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624022644/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2013%2F6%2F19%2Fnation%2F13257164&amp;sec=nation|archivedate=24 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; down to 85 on 20 June.

On 21 June 2013, a total of 437 hotspots were detected in Sumatra.&lt;ref name="Malaysia air improves (30 June 2013)"&gt;{{cite news | title=Air clears in Malaysia as Indonesian fires die out | work=The Sunday Times | date=30 June 2013 | page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, the number was down to 119. On 24 June 159 hotspots were detected in Riau, out of a total of 227 detected in Sumatra. An air force officer explained that the low number of hotspots detected on some days was due to heavy cloud cover, which prevented the satellite from detecting some of the hotspots.&lt;ref name="ST: Haze go Pekanbaru (24 June 2013)" /&gt; The Malaysia Department of Environment said that 173 hotspots were detected in Malaysia on 24 June, with 1 in [[Negeri Sembilan]], 1 in [[Terengganu]], 3 in [[Sabah]], and 168 in [[Sarawak]].&lt;ref name="The Star: Haze going north (25 June 2013)"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://beta.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2013/06/25/Dreaded-haze-heading-north-now-Air-quality-dropping-in-Malacca-Selangor-Negri-Sembilan-Perak-and-Pen.aspx | archive-url=https://archive.today/20130627025821/http://beta.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2013/06/25/Dreaded-haze-heading-north-now-Air-quality-dropping-in-Malacca-Selangor-Negri-Sembilan-Perak-and-Pen.aspx | dead-url=yes | archive-date=27 June 2013 | title=Dreaded haze heading north now | publisher=The Star | date=25 June 2013 | accessdate=25 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the hotspots were owned by [[palm oil]] companies or smallholder farmers who supply palm oil to these companies and use [[slash-and-burn]] methods to clear their land for the next planting season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Haze hits hazardous levels, Singapore and Indonesia at war of words |last=Cheam |first=Jessica |url=http://www.eco-business.com/news/haze-hits-hazardous-levels-singapore-and-indonesia-war-words/ |newspaper=Eco Business |date=20 June 2013 |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Singapore's Prime Minister, [[Lee Hsien Loong]], said that the fires were most likely started by errant companies, instead of slash-and-burn by smallholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-20/singapore-smog-reaches-hazardous-all-time-high-on-fires.html | title=Smog at Hazardous as Singapore, Jakarta Spar Over Fires | publisher=Bloomberg | date=21 June 2013 | accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 June, Indonesia's president [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] issued a formal apology to [[Malaysia]] and Singapore for the hazardous smog.&lt;ref name="investvine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investvine.com/indonesian-president-apologises-for-haze-disaster/|title=Indonesian president apologises for haze disaster|first=Arno|last=Maierbrugger|work=Inside Investor|date=25 June 2013|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 2013, 265 hotspots were detected by satellites, but decreased to 54 on 27 June after heavy rain fell overnight between the two days. Newly promoted [[Premier League]] team [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] also cancelled a week-long visit to Malaysia, the home of its billionaire owner, Vincent Tan, that was scheduled to begin that week, as a result of the severe haze.&lt;ref name="CNA: Rain douses fires (26 June 2013)" /&gt;

The number of hotspots in Sumatra continued to decrease on 27 June, with 42 hotspots recorded at 4pm. At the same time on 28 June, only 15 hotspots were detected by satellites. Singapore's [[National Environment Agency]] said that this could be the reason for the improving haze conditions in Singapore and Malaysia over the past week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Haze may have eased due to fewer fires: NEA | work=The Straits Times | date=29 June 2013 | agency=Singapore Press Holdings | page=A6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of hotspots decreased further to just 7 on 29 June.&lt;ref name="Malaysia air improves (30 June 2013)"/&gt;

The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) renewed calls for the enaction and enforcement of zero-burn policies. Based on satellite detection of hotspots, the province of Riau in Sumatra was found to contain over 88% of the hotspots that caused the worst haze over Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia since 1997. From 1 to 24 June, [[NASA]] satellites have detected a total of more than 9,000 hotspots in Sumatra, and more than 8,000 of them were located in Riau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wwf-renews-calls-for-zero/728154.html | title=WWF renews calls for zero-burn policies to be enacted | publisher=Channel NewsAsia | date=28 June 2013 | accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 29 June, a total of 2,800 military personnel, as well as helicopters and aircraft, were being deployed to fight the fires. About 3,000 civilians were also helping with the firefighting. The fires reduced from an area of 16,500ha to 4,081ha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Hot spot situation 'more under control': Jakarta | work=The Sunday Times | date=30 June 2013 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 4 hotspots were detected in Riau, the lowest number so far since the burning started.&lt;ref name="ST: Preventive mode (2 July 2013)"&gt;{{cite news | title=Indonesia's haze battle enters 'preventive mode' | work=The Straits Times | date=2 July 2013 | agency=Singapore Press Holdings | page=A6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 July 43 hotspots were detected in Sumatra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nst.com.my/nation/general/haze-is-back-with-riau-hot-spots-1.324164 | title=Haze is back with Riau hot spots | publisher=New Straits Times | date=22 July 2013 | accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, the number of hotspots rose sharply as Sumatra was experiencing dry weather. There were 159 hotspots in Sumatra, with 63 of them located in Riau.&lt;ref name="ST: Haze may return (22 July 2013)"&gt;{{cite news | title=Haze may return as hot spots increase | work=The Straits Times | date=22 July 2013 | agency=Singapore Press Holdings | page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July, the number of hotspots in Sumatra spiked to reach 261 as a result of the continuing dry weather. 173 hotspots were detected in Riau. The remaining hotspots were mainly located in the north of the island, in Aceh and North Sumatra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/haze-may-return-in-coming/751128.html | title=Haze may return in coming days: NEA | publisher=Channel NewsAsia | date=21 July 2013 | accessdate=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Malaysia, a total of 19 hotspots were detected. There were 7 hotspots in Johor, 4 each in Kelantan and Pahang, 2 in Perak, and 1 each in Selangor and Sabah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nst.com.my/nation/general/air-quality-worsens-1.324772 | title=Air quality worsens | publisher=New Straits Times | date=22 July 2013 | accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hotspots decreased slightly a day later. 167 hotspots were detected in Riau, out of a total of 252 in Sumatra.&lt;ref name="ST: Cloud seeding begins for second round of haze (23 July 2013)"&gt;{{cite news | title=Indonesia set to begin cloud seeding as haze threatens | work=The Straits Times | date=23 July 2013 | agency=Singapore Press Holdings | page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the number of hotspots in Riau climbed to 183 on 23 July, the highest number of hotspots detected in Riau since the haze returned.&lt;ref name="ST: Troops back in Riau (24 July 2013)"&gt;{{cite news | title=Troops, firefighters to be redeployed in Riau | work=The Straits Times | date=24 July 2013 | agency=Singapore Press Holdings }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 July, satellites detected 185 hotspots in Riau.&lt;ref name="TODAY: Fires set to worsen Indonesian haze (25 July 2013)"&gt;{{cite news | title=Fires set to worsen haze in Indonesia | work=TODAY | date=25 July 2013 | agency=Mediacorp }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesian authorities said that the number of hotspots is expected to rise in August, when slashing-and-burning activity is very likely to peak, thus causing the haze to possibly thicken and increase.&lt;ref name="TODAY: Fires set to worsen Indonesian haze (25 July 2013)" /&gt;

On 25 July, the number of hotspots in Riau decreased to 56, after 4 helicopters and 100 military personnel helped to fight the fires.&lt;ref name="TODAY: Haze moves north to Perak and Penang (26 July 2013)"&gt;{{cite news | title=Haze moves north to Perak and Penang | work=TODAY | date=26 July 2013 | agency=Mediacorp }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a sharp increase in the hotspots in Indonesia on 26 August 2013, with 488 hotspots detected. There were 308 hotspots the day after, on 27 August 2013.

==Countries affected==

===Brunei===
On 23 June, the Asean Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC) in Singapore detected 642 hotspots,&lt;ref name="BorneoHaze"&gt;{{cite news|title=Haze 'Unchanged' in Brunei|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2013/06/25/haze-unchanged-in-brunei/|accessdate=25 June 2013|publisher=The Borneo Post|date=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were scattered mostly in parts of central and west Borneo that caused a haze in [[Brunei]] and other parts of Borneo.&lt;ref name="BorneoHaze"/&gt; On 20 June, [[Brunei-Muara District]] recorded a "good" [[Pollutant Standards Index|PSI]] reading of 44, [[Belait District|Belait]] recorded a "moderate" 75, [[Temburong District|Temburong]] recorded a "moderate" 64, and [[Tutong District|Tutong]] recorded a "moderate" 66.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ministry allays fears over Brunei hazy conditions|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/news-national/2013/06/21/ministry-allays-fears-over-brunei-hazy-conditions|accessdate=25 June 2013|publisher=[[The Brunei Times]]|date=21 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624113609/http://www.bt.com.bn/news-national/2013/06/21/ministry-allays-fears-over-brunei-hazy-conditions|archive-date=24 June 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 21 June, The Department of Environment, Parks and Recreation of Brunei said the PSI readings were "relatively higher than normal", but air pollution levels were still considered "moderate" as the PSI readings in [[Brunei]] were still below 100. [[Belait District|Belait]] recorded the highest PSI reading (98), followed by Temburong (94), Tutong (92), and Brunei-Muara (65), which was the lowest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brunei haze worsens, visibility drops|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Haze/Story/A1Story20130622-431543.html|accessdate=25 June 2013|publisher=asiaone|date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 June, haze in Brunei remained unchanged with PSI readings in Brunei-Muara at a good 43, Belait at a moderate 75, Temburong at a moderate 72 and Tutong at a moderate 73.&lt;ref name="BorneoHaze"/&gt; On 26 June, the haze was gone from Brunei and PSI levels returned to "good" levels.&lt;ref name="BruneiHaze"&gt;{{cite news|title=Haze across country recedes considerably|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/news-national/2013/06/26/haze-across-country-recedes-considerably|accessdate=27 June 2013|publisher=The Brunei Times|date=26 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702134642/http://www.bt.com.bn/news-national/2013/06/26/haze-across-country-recedes-considerably|archive-date=2 July 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, "moderate" levels were still recorded on Tutong (70) and Belait (64).&lt;ref name="BruneiHaze"/&gt; The total number of hotspots also declined from the 231 reported on Saturday to 117 on Tuesday.&lt;ref name="BruneiHaze"/&gt;

====Measures taken====
During the haze period, the Brunei Ministry of Health released a health advisory to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GENERAL HEALTH ADVICE DURING HAZE|url=http://www.moh.gov.bn/satisticshealthguidelines/guidelines.htm|accessdate=27 June 2013|publisher=Ministry of Health Brunei Darussalam|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130628042534/http://www.moh.gov.bn/satisticshealthguidelines/guidelines.htm|archive-date=28 June 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public was also advised to regularly check the PSI (Pollutant Standard Index), follow the health advisory and seek treatment if they felt unwell because of haze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Health ministry issues haze advisory|url=http://mail.bruneitimes.com.bn/news-national/2013/06/25/health-ministry-issues-haze-advisory|date=25 June 2013|accessdate=27 June 2013|publisher=The Brunei Times|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130628042519/http://mail.bruneitimes.com.bn/news-national/2013/06/25/health-ministry-issues-haze-advisory|archive-date=28 June 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Pekanbaru]], capital of [[Riau]] province, where the majority of hotspots were located, visibility dropped and a number of Pekanbaru residents complained that the haze was affecting their health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Haze continues blanketing Pekanbaru|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/06/23/haze-continues-blanketing-pekanbaru.html|accessdate=22 June 2013|website=The Jakarta Post|date=21 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202125926/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/06/23/haze-continues-blanketing-pekanbaru.html|archive-date=2 February 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sultan Syarif Kasim II Airport]] had to be closed for several hours, causing several flights to be diverted to nearby airports such as [[Polonia International Airport]], [[Medan]] or to [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pekanbaru's airport shut down due to thick haze|url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/89465/pekanbarus-airport-shut-down-due-to-thick-haze|accessdate=22 June 2013|website=Antara News|date=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flights to and from [[Pinang Kampai Airport]] of [[Dumai]] were also suspended by the authorities because of poor visibility.&lt;ref name="ST: Downpour, 20 June 2013" /&gt;

While much of the press focused on the haze's impact in Singapore and Malaysia, the local residents of Riau were also affected. Residents fled their homes in Bengkalis, with about 30% experiencing respiratory problems. The fires burned through hectares of local farmland, decimating the season's crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Indonesia Can Only Wait for Rain as Riau Burns and Singapore Chokes|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/why-indonesia-can-only-wait-for-rain-as-riau-burns-and-singapore-chokes/|accessdate=22 June 2013|website=The Jakarta Globe|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PSI in [[Dumai]] hit 492 on the morning of 21 June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/se-asia/story/haze-update-dumai-psi-reaches-491-friday-morning-20130621|title=Haze update: In Dumai, PSI reaches 491 on Friday morning|date=21 June 2013|accessdate=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of the wind patterns, most parts of Indonesia were not hit by the haze.

Earlier on 22 June, Indonesian government blamed eight companies, including Jakarta-based [[Sinar Mas Group|PT Sinar Mas Agro Resources and Technology]] (SMART) and [[Asia Pacific Resources International Holdings|Asia Pacific Resources International]] (APRIL), for the fires.&lt;ref name="YahooNewsSIN"&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesian fires worsen, Singapore smog sets record|url=http://sg.news.yahoo.com/indonesian-fires-worsen-singapore-smog-sets-record-133942173.html|author=Kanupriya Kapoor and Michael Taylor|accessdate=22 June 2013|publisher=Reuters|website=Yahoo News Singapore|date=22 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624100329/http://sg.news.yahoo.com/indonesian-fires-worsen-singapore-smog-sets-record-133942173.html|archive-date=24 June 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on 22 June, Environment Minister Balthasar Kambuaya revealed that at least 20 plantation companies operating in Riau were suspected to have caused land and forest fires, of which 8 were Malaysian: PT Langgam Inti Hiberida, PT Bumi Rakksa Sejati, PT Tunggal Mitra Plantation, PT Udaya Loh Dinawi, PT Adei Plantation, PT Jatim Jaya Perkasa, PT Multi Gambut Industri and PT Mustika Agro Lestari.&lt;ref name="Antara"&gt;{{cite news|title=Malaysian firms suspected to have sent haze home|url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/89491/malaysian-firms-suspected-to-have-sent-haze-home|author=Andi Abdussalam|accessdate=23 June 2013|publisher=Antara|website=Antara|date=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following a meeting in Indonesia between Balthasar and Palanivel, only four of the companies were from Malaysia and the companies had denied any involvement in the fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Haze: Malaysia, Indonesia agree to work together to overcome haze problem|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2013/6/27/nation/20130627165730&amp;sec=nation|accessdate=27 June 2013|publisher=The Star|date=27 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627173844/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2013%2F6%2F27%2Fnation%2F20130627165730&amp;sec=nation|archive-date=27 June 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other local companies detected were PT Siak Seraya, PT Kimia Tirta Utama, PT Inti Indo Sawit Subur, Village Unit Cooperatives (KUD) Dayus Mas, PT Padasa Enam Utama, PT Kartayatam Bhakti Mulia, PT Langgam Inti Hibrindo, PT Riau Sakti Trans, PT Raja Garuda Masa Sejati, PT Sabira Negeri Utama, PT Guntung Hasrat Makmur, PT Panca Surya Agrindo, PT Bumi Reksa Nusa Sejati, PT Surya Bratasena Plantation, PT Adei Crumb Rubber, PT Rokan Adi Raya, Cooperatives 13 Anak Suku Bonai, PT Karyatama Bhakti Muli and PT Agroraya Gematrans.&lt;ref name="Antara"/&gt;

On the morning of 24 June, the haze shrouded [[Pekanbaru]], the provincial capital of [[Riau]]. The [[Pollutant Standards Index|PSI]] in Pekanbaru had been hovering around the moderate reading of 100 the previous week, but it rose to an unhealthy reading of 140 on the night of 23 June 2013. The same morning, several commercial flights at Syarif Kasim II Airport were delayed before takeoff by poor visibility caused by the haze.&lt;ref name="ST: Haze go Pekanbaru (24 June 2013)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/se-asia/story/haze-update-haze-covers-pekanbaru-despite-efforts-douse-fires-20130624|title=Haze update: Haze covers Pekanbaru despite efforts to douse fires|publisher=The Straits Times|date=24 June 2013|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Dumai, one of the worst-affected regencies in Riau, visibility was reduced to less than 500m after the PSI hit a hazardous record of 900. This was the highest in any haze crisis and three times above the minimum "Hazardous" level.&lt;ref name="ST: Preventive mode (2 July 2013)" /&gt;

On 25 June, eight Indonesian farmers were arrested for creating fires that set in motion the blazes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investvine.com/eight-indonesians-arrested-as-singapore-haze-creeps-back-join-the-discussion/|title=Eight Indonesians arrested as Singapore haze creeps back – Join the discussion|first=Justin|last=Calderon|work=Inside Investor|date=27 June 2013|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number increased to 23 on 1 July, after another six farmers were arrested for carrying out illegal slash-and-burn activities.&lt;ref name="ST: Preventive mode (2 July 2013)"/&gt;

Indonesia said that it would ratify the 2002 ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution as soon as possible. Indonesia's Environment Minister, Balthasar Kambuaya, emphasised the importance of ratifying the agreement, saying that Indonesia should be concerned about the impact of the haze on its own people, and also the well-being of people in neighbouring countries affected by the haze. As of 6 July 2013, Indonesia had yet to ratify the pact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Jakarta moves to ratify Asean haze pact | work=The Straits Times | date=5 July 2013 | agency=Singapore Press Holdings }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July, thick haze blanketed Dumai again because of the sudden increase in the number of hotspots, with visibility at street level dropping to below 200m.&lt;ref name="ST: Haze may return (22 July 2013)"/&gt;

On 22 July, many parts of Riau recorded hazardous PSI readings. The worst reading, 619, was recorded in [[Rumbai]], north of Pekanbaru, the provincial capital of Riau.&lt;ref name="ST: Cloud seeding begins for second round of haze (23 July 2013)" /&gt; Since then, the air quality in Riau has been worsening. Flights to and from Pekanbaru were delayed because of the deteriorating visibility.&lt;ref name="TODAY: Fires set to worsen Indonesian haze (25 July 2013)" /&gt;

====Measures taken====
The Indonesian government used weather-changing technology to create [[Cloud seeding|artificial rain]] and extinguish raging fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Forestry Ministry Looks to Cloud-Seeding to Douse Forest Fires Raging in Sumatra|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/forestry-ministry-looks-to-cloud-seeding-to-douse-forest-fires-raging-in-sumatra-2/|accessdate=22 June 2013|website=The Jakarta Globe|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It earmarked around 200 billion rupiah (around US$20M, S$25.6M at the time) to handle the disaster and deployed seven military aircraft for water bombings and cloud-seeding to fight raging forest fires on 21 June 2013.&lt;ref name="YahooNewsSIN"/&gt;

In June alone, more than 3000 soldiers, marines and air force officers were deployed to help fight the fires.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg: Cloud seeding on return of haze (25 July 2013)"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-23/indonesia-prepares-cloud-seeding-as-haze-returns.html | title=Indonesia Prepares Cloud Seeding as Haze Returns | publisher=Bloomberg | date=24 July 2013 | accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Agriculture Minister [[Suswono]] stated that an investigation has been launched to find the firms responsible for the air pollution, and agreed to publish the names of the firms if they were proven guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia to punish firm burning forest|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90777/8293264.html|accessdate=22 June 2013|website=People's Daily|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forestry Minister Zulkifli Hasan said the government would not tolerate companies burning land and bushes that caused the haze shrouding Riau and its surroundings. Companies which are proved to have used slash-and-burn to clear land would be acted upon firmly. The government assigned the [[Indonesian National Police|National Police]] to handle the legal process and make sanctions against firms behind forest fires.&lt;ref name="Antara"/&gt;

At dawn on 23 June, rain fell for 30 minutes in [[Dumai]], the coastal city nearest to many of the hotspots, as a result of cloud-seeding. Rain fell on Dumai again at 5pm on the same day, after a Hercules C-130 jet commenced cloud-seeding in the Bengkalis district as well as Dumai at 2pm.&lt;ref name="ST: Haze go Pekanbaru (24 June 2013)" /&gt; However, not much rain fell.&lt;ref name="CNA: Haze suffocate Malaysia (24 June 2013)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/malaysia-suffocated-by/722232.html|title=Malaysia suffocated by haze|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|date=24 June 2013|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; First Lieutenant Fajar Gusthana, one of those who did the cloud-seeding, said that it was difficult as there were very few clouds, and the clouds were generally quite thin. He also said that there were no clouds directly above the hotspots, which made it harder for them to carry out the cloud-seeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rain-inducing efforts bring some relief to Riau|work=The Straits Times|date=24 June 2013|agency=Singapore Press Holdings |page=A12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 June, Indonesia said that it would start larger scale water-bombing in one week. Indonesia planned to do this with the help of rented Russian Kamov helicopters with belly tanks that could carry 8,000 litres of water, compared with Indonesian helicopters carrying 500 litres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Jakarta to step up water bombing | work=The Straits Times | date=28 June 2013 | agency=Singapore Press Holdings }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indonesia switched into preventive mode on 1 July, after it had successfully put out most of the fires, although fires were still raging underground in the [[peatland]]. To enable itself to respond faster and extinguish the fires before they got out of control again, Indonesia increased night patrols. Water-bombing and cloud-seeding aircraft were placed on standby. Indonesia has said that the standby aircraft should be able to respond quickly to the fires and fly out immediately to [[Jambi]], [[South Sumatra]], and [[Lampung]] in [[Sumatra]], as well as four provinces in [[Kalimantan]] on [[Borneo]]. Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency spokesman Dr Agus Wibowo said that Indonesia expects fires to affect seven other provinces as well, as the dry season was not at its peak yet and was expected to continue until October.&lt;ref name="ST: Preventive mode (2 July 2013)"/&gt;

As of 21 July, there were four helicopters and an aeroplane on standby in Riau, so that fires could be put out using cloud seeding and water bombing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Regional/2013/07/21/Clear-skies-in-Dumai-but-for-how-long.aspx | title=Clear skies in Dumai, but for how long? | publisher=The Star Online | date=21 July 2013 | accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statement from Indonesia's disaster management agency on 22 July said that there were a total of 6 aeroplanes on standby for cloud seeding, while soldiers were also placed on standby to help fight any fires that occurred.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg: Cloud seeding on return of haze (25 July 2013)" /&gt;

Indonesia began cloud-seeding and water bombing over Riau on 22 July, to reduce the number of hotspots which had risen sharply over the prior weekend and caused the haze to return to Malaysia. More than 370 firefighters were deployed to fight the fires, with 3 helicopters used for water bombing.&lt;ref name="ST: Cloud seeding begins for second round of haze (23 July 2013)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TODAY: Fires set to worsen Indonesian haze (25 July 2013)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNA: SG express concern as hotspots rise (22 June 2013)"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/s-pore-expresses-concern/752494.html | title=S'pore expresses concern to Indonesia as hotspots in Sumatra rise | publisher=Channel NewsAsia | date=22 July 2013 | accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Pekanbaru, the provincial capital of Riau, there were more than 22 water-bombing operations carried out. However, there was only one cloud-seeding operation conducted, as there were insufficient clouds over Pekanbaru to make rain.&lt;ref name="ST: Troops back in Riau (24 July 2013)"/&gt;

Willem Rampangilei, a deputy minister at the Coordinating Ministry for People's Welfare, said that the provincial government had already tried its best to fight the fires, but the number of hotspots remained about the same. He also said that following the failure to decrease the number of hotspots significantly, Jakarta would send more troops to fight the fires.&lt;ref name="ST: Troops back in Riau (24 July 2013)"/&gt;

On 24 July, planes conducted cloud seeding operations, to reduce the haze which had shrouded Riau and the Straits of Malacca for the past few days.&lt;ref name="TODAY: Fires set to worsen Indonesian haze (25 July 2013)" /&gt;

On 8 January 2014, the Meulaboh district court on Sumatra island ruled that Indonesian company Kallista Alam had illegally burnt vegetation on 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) of peatland in Aceh province to clear it for a palm oil plantation. In the civil case brought by the Ministry of Environment, the court ordered the company to pay 114.3 billion rupiah (S$9.4 million) in losses to the state and 252 billion rupiah to rehabilitate the land it destroyed.&lt;ref name="Indonesian palm oil firm to pay losses in 'historic' ruling"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.xin.msn.com/en/regional/indonesia/indonesian-palm-oil-firm-to-pay-losses-in-historic-ruling-1 | title=Indonesian palm oil firm to pay losses in 'historic' ruling | publisher=Agence France-Presse | date=9 January 2014 | accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The haze that affected Malaysia was the worst since 2005, starting with the [[Air Pollution Index|Air Pollution Index (API)]] hitting 172 on 19 June.&lt;ref name="Haze record"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/searealtime/2013/06/18/haze-shrouds-singapore-malaysia/|title=Haze Shrouds Singapore, Malaysia|accessdate=19 June 2013|newspaper=Online Wall Street Journal|date=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 June, there were only two areas recording unhealthy API values, a reduction from six areas on 16 June.&lt;ref name="Malaysia Haze"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/Dalam_Negeri/20130618/dn_12/Hanya-dua-kawasan-bacaan-IPU-tidak-sihat|title=Hanya dua kawasan bacaan IPU tidak sihat|language=Malay|accessdate=19 June 2013|newspaper=Utusan Malaysia|date=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/Dalam_Negeri/20130617/dn_10/Enam-kawasan-catat-IPU-tidak-sihat|title=Enam kawasan catat IPU tidak sihat|language=Malay|accessdate=19 June 2013|newspaper=Utusan Malaysia|date=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Malaysian Department of Environment, the two areas were [[Kemaman]], [[Terengganu]] (118) and Balok Baru, [[Kuantan]], [[Pahang]] (110).&lt;ref name="Malaysia Haze"/&gt; On 19 June, API readings at 5 p.m. by the Malaysian Department of Environment showed that [[Johor]] and [[Malacca]] were the two states worst affected by the haze. The highest reading in Johor was 172, recorded in [[Muar District|Muar]], while that of Malacca was 161, recorded in the state capital, [[Malacca City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doe.gov.my/apims/index.php?gmap=load&amp;date=2013-06-19|title=API readings by Malaysian Department of Environment: 19 June 2013|publisher=Malaysian Department of Environment|accessdate=19 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621100428/http://www.doe.gov.my/apims/index.php?gmap=load&amp;date=2013-06-19|archive-date=21 June 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 June, the haze in Malaysia worsened. Johor and Malacca remained the worst-affected states. In Johor, Muar recorded a hazardous reading (383) at 11 a.m., which was one of the worst among the readings. [[Kota Tinggi]] was the second worst, hitting a ''Very unhealthy'' reading of 232. In Malacca, an [[API]] reading of 137 was recorded in Malacca City exceeding the ''Unhealthy'' API. Readings in other parts of Malaysia ranged from ''Good'' to ''Unhealthy''.&lt;ref name="API readings by Malaysian Department of Environment: 20 June 2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doe.gov.my/apims/index.php?gmap=load&amp;date=2013-06-20|title=API readings by Malaysian Department of Environment: 20 June 2013|date=20 June 2013|accessdate=20 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728052404/http://www.doe.gov.my/apims/index.php?gmap=load|archive-date=28 July 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A day later, the Malaysian Meteorological Department predicted that the haze would not dissipate until 26 June, when tropical storm Bebinca was expected to be blown from the southwest, bringing strong winds and dry weather to carry the smog from Sumatra over to West Malaysia. The Johor State Health Department reported the number of citizens with upper respiratory tract ailments increased by at least 21%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HAZE UPDATE: Kota Tinggi, Pasir Gudang still at hazardous level|url=http://www.nst.com.my/latest/font-color-red-haze-update-font-kota-tinggi-pasir-gudang-still-at-hazardous-level-1.304686|publisher=New Straits Times|date=21 June 2013|accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June, the [[Air Pollution Index|Air Pollution Index (API)]] in Muar, Johor spiked to 746 at 7 a.m. which was almost 2.5 times the lower end of the ''Hazardous'' level thus resulting in the declaration of a state of emergency in Muar and Ledang (which was afterwards lifted on 25 June in the morning), leaving the towns in virtual shutdown. It was also almost 450 more than the minimum range of the ''Hazardous'' level.&lt;ref name="Channel News Asia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thestar1"/&gt;

On 24 June, shifting winds blew the haze northwards away from Johor and Singapore, towards [[Malacca]], [[Selangor]], [[Negeri Sembilan]], [[Perak]] and [[Penang]]. The haze also blanketed the east coast, especially the states of [[Pahang]], [[Terengganu]], and [[Kelantan]]. Air quality in central and northern Peninsula Malaysia was also worsening.&lt;ref name="The Star: Haze going north (25 June 2013)" /&gt; [[Kuala Lumpur]] recorded an ''Unhealthy'' API of 198 at 11 a.m. indicating the first reading in KL to be on the cusp of entering the ''Very unhealthy'' range in the haze season. [[Port Dickson]] was the worst hit by the haze, with the API entering the ''Hazardous'' range with a reading of 335 at 7 a.m., although the figure decreased to a ''Very unhealthy'' reading of 292 at 11 a.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doe.gov.my/apims/index.php?gmap=load&amp;date=2013-06-24|title=API readings by Malaysian Department of Environment: 24 June 2013|publisher=Malaysia Department of Environment|date=24 June 2013|accessdate=24 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728052404/http://www.doe.gov.my/apims/index.php?gmap=load|archive-date=28 July 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the haze had cleared off a bit in the southern parts of the nation, [[Port Klang]] recorded a ''Very unhealthy'' series of API values which reached the ''Hazardous'' range with a reading of 487 in the morning of 25 June. The drifting smoke from the south also caused other places in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur to be blanketed by thick smog, resulting in the API coming very close to entering the ''Hazardous'' level. [[Seri Manjung]] in Perak which is 200&amp;nbsp;km away from Port Klang was also hit hard by the haze.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/now-its-haze-choking-port-klang-at-487/ "Now, the haze is choking Port Klang at 487"], ''[[The Malaysian Insider]]'', Malaysia. 25 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Visibility remained poor in Kuala Lumpur and several other states.

Malaysians were able to breathe easier when the overnight rain in numerous parts of the west coast helped to clear the skies. There was a significant drop in the API values in most areas, including Port Klang since 26 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nst.com.my/latest/font-color-red-haze-update-font-api-improving-in-selangor-1.308170|title=HAZE UPDATE: API improving in Selangor|work=[[New Straits Times]]|date=26 June 2013|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June, the improvement in API readings continued, with the PSI readings hovering in the ''Good'' and ''Moderate'' ranges. At 5pm, the worst PSI readings were in the ''Moderate'' range, recorded in [[Kota Tinggi]] and [[Bukit Rambai]], at 81 and 86 respectively.&lt;ref name="Malaysia air improves (30 June 2013)"/&gt;

On 21 July, the haze blanketed certain states of Malaysia yet again. Some parts of Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, and Malacca were hit with API readings in the higher part of the ''Moderate'' range. Bukit Rambai, in the state of Malacca, was worst hit. At 12am, a moderate API reading of 94 was recorded. The reading then continued to escalate, hitting right at the very end of the ''Moderate'' range (100) at 7am, and entered the ''Unhealthy'' range an hour later. The air quality in Bukit Rambai continued to worsen, and the highest API value of the day, 118, was recorded at 8pm and 9pm. It began to subside at 10pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly1.php?date=2013-07-21 | title=API readings: 21 July 2013 from 12am to 5am | publisher=Malaysian Department of Environment | date=21 July 2013 | accessdate=21 July 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726133637/http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly1.php?date=2013-07-21 | archive-date=26 July 2013 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly2.php?date=2013-07-21 | title=API readings: 21 July 2013 from 6am to 11am | publisher=Malaysian Department of Environment | date=21 July 2013 | accessdate=21 July 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714182103/http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly2.php?date=2013-07-21 | archive-date=14 July 2014 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly3.php?date=2013-07-21 | title=API readings: 21 July 2013 from 12pm to 5pm | publisher=Malaysian Department of Environment | date=21 July 2013 | accessdate=21 July 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714134900/http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly3.php?date=2013-07-21 | archive-date=14 July 2014 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly4.php?date=2013-07-21 | title=API readings: 21 July 2013 from 6pm to 11pm | publisher=Malaysian Department of Environment | date=21 July 2013 | accessdate=21 July 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714182851/http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly4.php?date=2013-07-21 | archive-date=14 July 2014 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 July, the haze conditions in Selangor, Malacca and Negeri Sembilan worsened. Johor also got hit by the haze. Bukit Rambai remained the worst hit of all, with an unhealthy API of 135, the worst since the haze returned, recorded there. Muar, Malacca City, Banting, and Kuala Lumpur also recorded unhealthy readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly3.php?date=2013-07-22 | title=API readings: 22 July 2013 from 12pm to 5pm | publisher=Malaysian Department of Environment | date=22 July 2013 | accessdate=22 July 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725001921/http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly3.php?date=2013-07-22 | archive-date=25 July 2013 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 July, the haze conditions changed again. At 8am, API readings in Port Klang was 105, 116 in Bukit Rambai and 115 in Muar.

Visibility at several Malaysian airports was reduced by the haze, which travelled northwards to the northern states of [[Terengganu]], [[Kelantan]] and [[Penang]]. In Terengganu, visibility at the [[Sultan Mahmud Airport]] in [[Kuala Terengganu]] was reduced to 3&amp;nbsp;km in the evening, while visibility at [[Kerteh Airport]] was reduced to 6&amp;nbsp;km. In Penang, the [[Penang International Airport]] in [[Bayan Lepas]] also had visibility reduced to 6&amp;nbsp;km. However, in Kelantan, visibility at the [[Sultan Ismail Petra Airport]] in [[Kota Baru]] was at a safe 10&amp;nbsp;km. [[Petaling Jaya]] and [[Subang, Selangor|Subang]], both in Selangor, were also hit by poor visibility at around noon, but it gradually improved to reach 6&amp;nbsp;km and 9&amp;nbsp;km respectively.&lt;ref name="The Star: Haze spreads northwards (24 July 2013)"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2013/07/24/Haze-continues-slow-spread-northwards-Several-states-experience-poor-visibility-levels.aspx | title=Haze continues slow spread northwards | publisher=The Star | date=24 July 2013 | accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The haze was expected to ease over [[Johor]], [[Pahang]], [[Klang Valley]], Muar, Malacca City and [[Manjung]] on 25 July, where rain was expected.&lt;ref name="The Star: Haze spreads northwards (24 July 2013)" /&gt; However, Kuala Lumpur, Petaling Jaya, Kuala Selangor, Putrajaya, Port Dickson would remain dry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayonline.com/world/asia/haze-worsens-malaysia|title=Haze worsens in Malaysia|publisher=Today Online|date=23 July 2013|accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 July, Ipoh, Tanjung Malim, and Perai recorded unhealthy API levels in the afternoon, at 106 (4pm), 101 (5pm) and 102 (1pm and 2pm) respectively. API readings for the day were mostly moderate in Malaysia, although a few areas recorded good readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly3.php?date=2013-07-25 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130726144910/http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly3.php?date=2013-07-25 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=26 July 2013 | title=API readings: 25 July 2013 from 12pm to 5pm | publisher=Malaysian Department of Environment | date=25 July 2013 | accessdate=27 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 July, the haze continued to be blown towards the northern parts of Malaysia. Air quality in most parts of Malaysia were in the ''Moderate'' range for the day. The worst hit areas were [[Ipoh]], the state capital of [[Perak]], and [[Seberang Jaya]], in [[Penang]], where unhealthy API levels were recorded in the afternoon. The highest API reading of the day, 106, was recorded in Ipoh at 4pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly3.php?date=2013-07-25 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130726144910/http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly3.php?date=2013-07-25 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=26 July 2013 | title=API readings: 25 July 2013 from 12pm to 5pm | publisher=Malaysian Department of Environment | date=25 July 2013 | accessdate=26 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July, Bukit Rambai (Malacca), Seri Manjung (Perak), Port Klang (Selangor) and Perai (Penang) were worst affected, with the highest API readings at 82 (11pm), 87 (12am), 84 (12am) and 87 (12am).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly1.php?date=2013-07-26 | title=API readings: 26 July 2013 | publisher=Malaysian Department of Environment | date=26 July 2013 | accessdate=27 July 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728160650/http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly1.php?date=2013-07-26 | archive-date=28 July 2013 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 July, air quality in many parts of Malaysia returned to the ''Good'' range, although some remained in the ''Moderate'' range. From 12am to 5am, most of the API readings were in the lower part of the ''Moderate'' range. However, Bukit Rambai, Seri Manjung, Port Klang and Ipoh remained the worst affected areas, with a highest API reading of 83 (multiple times in the morning), 79 (2am and 3am) and 78 (2am and 3am) respectively. Ipoh's API almost entered the ''Unhealthy'' range, recording the worst reading of the day, 99, at 3pm. This was only one point away from the "Unhealthy" range, in which even the slightest increase could result in the entering of the "Unhealthy" range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly1.php?date=2013-07-27 | title=API readings: 27 July 2013 from 12am to 5am | publisher=Malaysian Department of Environment | date=27 July 2013 | accessdate=27 July 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728160809/http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly1.php?date=2013-07-27 | archive-date=28 July 2013 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 July, air quality remained in the ''Moderate'' range in many parts of Malaysia during the day, although most areas recorded good readings in the early morning. Bukit Rambai's air quality remained in the ''Moderate'' range for the whole day. Its worst reading was 82, recorded at 10pm and 11pm. In Negeri Sembilan, [[Seremban]] was worst-affected, recording a moderate 84 at 4pm. Ipoh's worst reading was a moderate 92, also at 4pm. Selangor, which included the capital state of [[Wilayah Persekutuan]], was worst-hit. [[Petaling Jaya]], [[Putrajaya]], and the [[Cheras, Kuala Lumpur|Cheras]] area of [[Kuala Lumpur]] all recorded unhealthy API levels.

On 29 July, Bukit Rambai, Seremban, Banting, Port Klang, Kuala Lumpur, Petaling Jaya and [[Shah Alam]] were worst hit. Excluding KL, their worst readings were 84 (11pm), 95 (4pm), 82 (10pm), 92 (11pm), 81 (10–11pm) and 80 (11pm). The Batu Muda area of KL recorded its worst reading of 83 from 2pm to 6pm. The Cheras area of KL recorded readings in the lower part of the ''Moderate'' range for most part of the day, but was the only place to breach the ''Unhealthy'' range, when an API reading of 102 was recorded at 1pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly1.php?date=2013-07-29 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130730105154/http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly1.php?date=2013-07-29 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=30 July 2013 | title=API readings: 29 July 2013 | publisher=Malaysian Department of Environment | date=29 July 2013 | accessdate=30 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, air quality in the other badly affected areas of the previous day improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly1.php?date=2013-07-30 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130730110935/http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly1.php?date=2013-07-30 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=30 July 2013 | title=API readings: 30 July 2013 | publisher=Malaysian Department of Environment | date=30 July 2013 | accessdate=30 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 July, Bukit Rambai remained the worst affected area. API readings there hovered in the 80s, although occasionally dropping to the upper 70s, like the past few days. The highest reading was 84, at 10am. That was also the highest reading for the day in Malaysia. Port Klang's API readings rose from the 50s in the early morning to 77 (5–9pm). For most of the day, it was in the 70s. API readings in some other areas like [[Kemaman]] in Terrenganu, Banting, Malacca City and Muar were in the 60s for most of the day. Tanjung Malim's air quality was good for most of the day, but spiked suddenly to reach 72 at 3pm, and 75 an hour later. It gradually decreased and returned to the ''Good'' range at 8pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly1.php?date=2013-07-31 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130731154704/http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly1.php?date=2013-07-31 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=31 July 2013 | title=API readings: 31 July 2013 | publisher=Malaysian Department of Environment | date=31 July 2013 | accessdate=31 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August, Bukit Rambai remained the worst-affected. API readings there dropped gradually during the morning, reaching 68 at 11am, the lowest recorded there for many days already. However, it then increased quickly for the rest of the day, breaching the 80 mark at 3pm. At 4pm, API was 90. As of 10pm, the API was 92. The highest API for the day in Bukit Rambai was 93, recorded at 9pm. That was also the highest reading of the day in Malaysia. [[Port Dickson]]'s air quality remained between 52 and 70 for most of the day. However, it suddenly increased to 78 at 3pm and 83 at 4pm, before dropping an hour later. In Kuala Lumpur, air quality was mainly in the 50s. But in the Cheras area of KL, API readings soared to 71 at 2pm, then to 86 at 3pm, 77 at 4pm, before returning to the 50s. In [[Seremban]], air quality hovered around 60 for most of the day, although at 3pm, a reading of 80 was recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly1.php?date=2013-08-01 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130801151719/http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly1.php?date=2013-08-01 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=1 August 2013 | title=API readings: 1 August 2013 | publisher=Malaysian Department of Environment | date=1 August 2013 | accessdate=1 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 August, the haze still hit Bukit Rambai the hardest. In the early morning, the API readings continued rising up the 90s, hitting 100 at 5am. That meant it was at the top of the "Moderate" range and even if it were to increase by only 1, that's it and it would enter the "Unhealthy" range. At 6am, the API reading entered the ''Unhealthy'' range, hovering between 101 and 105. The highest reading, 105, was recorded at noon. At 3pm, the air quality was back in the ''Moderate'' range, and subsided gradually. At 9pm, it was 84. However, instead of Bukit Rambai, it was Tanjung Malim which recorded the worst reading of the day, 114, at 5pm. That was also the highest in Malaysia. Like the past few days, Tanjung Malim's air quality was ''Good'' for most of the day, only spiking for a few hours each day. The air quality there entered the ''Moderate'' range at 2pm, and returned to the ''Good'' range at 8pm. Other than the above two locations, Kemaman, Port Dickson, Seremban, Nilai and Malacca City also recorded air quality in the 70s for a few hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly1.php?date=2013-08-02 | title=API readings: 2 August 2013 | publisher=Malaysian Department of Environment | date=2 August 2013 | accessdate=2 August 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714202135/http://apims.doe.gov.my/apims/hourly1.php?date=2013-08-02 | archive-date=14 July 2014 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 10 p.m. on 19 June 2013, the 3-hour PSI reading of 321 breached the ''Hazardous'' zone for the first time in history, surpassing its previous record of 226 (Very unhealthy) during the [[1997 Southeast Asian haze|1997 haze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/haze-singapore-hits-new-high-psi-321-10pm-20130619|title=S'pore PSI hits all-time high, PSI at 321 at 10pm|publisher=The Straits Times|date=19 June 2013|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 10 p.m. reading was released 57 minutes late at 10:57&amp;nbsp;p.m. and the reading soon decreased to 282 at 11 p.m., and 218 at 12 a.m., both of which are in the ''Very unhealthy'' range. At 1 p.m. on 20 June 2013, the 3-hour PSI reading reached record levels once again with a reading of 371 in the ''Hazardous'' range, a jump from 299 an hour ago, which was only one point shy of the "Hazardous" level.

At 11 a.m. on 21 June 2013, another new all-time high was recorded, with a PSI of 400. The new record was broken again at 12 p.m., with the PSI remaining in the ''Hazardous'' range at 401.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/psi-hits-new-all-time/719496.html |title=PSI hits new all-time high of 401 on Friday |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |date=21 June 2013 |accessdate=21 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624015317/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/psi-hits-new-all-time/719496.html |archivedate=24 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with prior haze events, this strained ties between Indonesia and Singapore, with Indonesia swiftly pushing the blame for the haze to Singapore and Malaysia, which invested in palm oil firms in the area of the burning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/singapore/10127259/Singapore-and-Indonesia-clash-over-regional-haze.html|newspaper=[[Telegraph.co.uk|Telegraph]]|title=Singapore and Indonesia clash over regional haze|date=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister of Singapore, [[Lee Hsien Loong]], as well as [[Vivian Balakrishnan]], the Singaporean Minister of Environment and Water Resources, expressed concern over the haze and called on Indonesia to do more to resolve the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/the-big-story/the-haze-singapore/story/haze-update-pm-lee-says-singapore-urging-indonesia-take-actio|date=18 June 2013|title=Haze update: PM Lee says Singapore urging Indonesia to take action to reduce haze|author=Feng Zengkun|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Indonesian officials became irate at the demands, and on Thursday Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare Agung Laksono accused Singapore of acting "like a child."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/indonesia-chides/717798.html | title=Indonesia chides Singapore over reactions on haze situation | publisher=Channel NewsAsia | date=20 June 2013 | accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Singapore's Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong responded that "the Singapore Child is being suffocated", borrowing the same descriptor to highlight the nation's innocence yet vulnerability in the haze crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Singapore child is being suffocated," says ESM Goh|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/specialreports/hazewatch/news/singapore-child-is-being/719626.html|publisher=Channel News Asia|accessdate=22 June 2013|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[cloud seeding]] was suggested to get rid of the haze, Singapore's meteorological service found it not possible because of insufficient cloud cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/the-big-story/the-haze-singapore/story/haze-update-record-321-psi-10pm-plans-place-if-haze-worsens-2|date=20 June 2013|title=Haze update: Record 321 PSI at 10pm; plans in place if haze worsens|first=Zengkun|last=Feng|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, [[Respirator#Mechanical filter respirators|face masks]] were sold out in major drugstores and other retailers because of strong demand,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/100830090 Face Masks, Anyone?

On 22 June 2013, the haze started giving way to clear skies as the PSI dropped from 326 at 10am in the ''Hazardous'' range to 73 at 5pm in the ''Moderate'' range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Haze update: 3pm reading down to 122 as more reports of blue skies|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/the-big-story/the-haze-singapore/story/haze-update-3pm-reading-down-122-more-reports-blue-skies-2013|accessdate=22 June 2013|date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the improvement was sustained in the morning, with the PSI in the ''Moderate'' range. The improvement in the air quality was due to a change in the direction of the low level winds over Singapore, from south-westerly to southerly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://app2.nea.gov.sg/corporate-functions/newsroom/advisories/haze-update-from-nea-(12pm-on-23-june-2013)|title=Haze Update From NEA (12PM on 23 June 2013)|publisher=National Environment Agency|date=23 June 2013|accessdate=23 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626063058/http://app2.nea.gov.sg/corporate-functions/newsroom/advisories/haze-update-from-nea-(12pm-on-23-june-2013)|archive-date=26 June 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As dry conditions and winds blowing from the southwest or west persisted, the 24-hour PSI reading for the rest of the day was expected to be in the ''Moderate'' range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haze Update from NEA (12pm on 23 June 2013)|url=http://app2.nea.gov.sg/corporate-functions/newsroom/advisories/haze-update-from-nea-(12pm-on-23-june-2013)|publisher=National Environmental Agency|accessdate=23 June 2013|date=23 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626063058/http://app2.nea.gov.sg/corporate-functions/newsroom/advisories/haze-update-from-nea-(12pm-on-23-june-2013)|archive-date=26 June 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the night the PSI reached 102, which is in the ''Unhealthy'' range, in the west. The readings increased as the night passed.

In the late afternoon of 25 June 2013, thunderstorms accompanied by strong, gusty winds drenched many parts of Singapore with heavy rain and hailstones even fell in the western part of Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hail rains down on western Singapore|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/the-big-story/asia-report/singapore/story/hail-rains-down-western-singapore-20130626|accessdate=27 June 2015|agency=The Straits Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storms were a welcome respite, after Singapore had endured a week of record-breaking haze and no rain.

Singapore's Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Dr Vivian Balakrishnan assured Singaporeans that Singapore's water quality had not been affected by the haze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/water-quality-not/724848.html | title=Water quality not affected by haze: Vivian Balakrishnan | publisher=Channel NewsAsia | date=26 June 2013 | accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 June 2013, a morning shower caused a significant decrease in the 3-hour PSI readings. The PSI had dropped into the ''Good'' range. However, PM2.5 concentrations for the past few days had remained unhealthy, and this was predicted to continue into the coming days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.straitstimes.com/the-big-story/the-haze-singapore/story/haze-update-sunday-be-unhealthy-20130629 | title=Haze Update: Sunday to be unhealthy | publisher = The Straits Times | date=29 June 2013 | accessdate = 30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/slightly-hazy-conditions/729414.html | title=Slightly hazy conditions expected for Monday: NEA | publisher=Channel NewsAsia | date=30 June 2013 | accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July, the PSI readings remained in the ''Good'' range for most of the day. The highest PSI readings of the day were 49–53 (''Moderate''). PSI readings on 2 and 3 July were also in the ''Good'' range.

On 5 July 2013, a PSI reading of 6 was recorded – the lowest reading since the haze started blowing towards Singapore.

Despite Malaysia getting hit by the haze on 21 and 22 July, Singapore remained relatively unaffected, as the winds were mainly blowing from the south or southeast.&lt;ref name="ST: Haze may return (22 July 2013)"/&gt;

On 26 July, the PSI reached the 40s for the first time in weeks, reaching a high of 46.&lt;ref name=hazegovsg&gt;{{cite web|title=NEA haze readings for past 24 hours (refreshed daily)|url=http://www.haze.gov.sg/haze-update/past-24-hour-psi-reading.aspx|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130727145441/http://www.haze.gov.sg/haze-update/past-24-hour-psi-reading.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-07-27|publisher=National Environment Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 July, the PSI reached a high of 44,&lt;ref name=hazegovsg /&gt; but decreased again the next day because of thunderstorms.&lt;ref name=hazegovsg /&gt;

On 20 August, the haze briefly returned to Singapore during the afternoon with the PSI rising to 55.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/haze-in-singapore-due-to/784088.html | title=Haze in Singapore due to Sumatra fires: NEA | publisher=Channel NewsAsia | date=20 August 2013 | accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Measures taken====
Over the first four days of the haze, the government and other institutions implemented a series of safety precautions meant to reduce exposure to the haze.

The fire had engulfed more than {{Convert|3000|ha}} of plantations and forests, and it was no longer possible to put out the widespread fire. Hadi also mentioned that it would take two weeks to use cloud-seeding to put out the fires, and that the haze could last for weeks, or even months, if there was no downpour. Other than deploying many firefighters to the scene, Indonesia also turned to water bombing to extinguish the fires.

* {{flagu|Singapore}} – On 21 June, Emeritus Senior Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] stated on his Facebook page that "the Singapore Child is being suffocated, how can he not scream?". This was in response to Agung Laksono's comments on Singaporeans "behaving like a child" over the haze issue, made the day before. Using an example of Malaysian and Singaporeans being neighbours, he stressed that one should be considerate for another and co-operate with one another in fighting the haze instead of blaming one another. He then quoted an act of "burning our garden refuse openly if the smoke will enter our neighbour's house" for instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/singapore-child-being-suffocated-goh-chok-tong.html |website=Channel NewsAsia |title=The 'Singapore Child is being suffocated': Goh Chok Tong |date=21 June 2013 |accessdate=21 June 2013 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June 2013, [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Singapore)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] and [[Ministry of Law (Singapore)|Minister for Law]] [[K.

In response to provocative remarks made by several Indonesian ministers, he stressed that the attitude by those ministers will not improve the problem any further, instead the main concern should be dedicated in solving the haze situation. He has added that Indonesia has not been carrying "the same tone of cooperation" that both countries once had over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/singapore-cannot-do-nothing-and-say-nothing-about-haze-shanmugam |website=TODAYonline |title=Singapore cannot 'do nothing and say nothing' about haze: Shanmugam |date=22 June 2013 |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 June, Singapore Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] accepted Indonesia President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono|Susilo Bambang]]'s apology wholeheartedly, and said that the apology was a very gracious act.

===International reactions===
* '''[[Greenpeace International]]''' – The environmental organisation thought of the situation as an "international problem", stating that "nothing could be more illustrative of forest destruction than the polluting haze that is coming from [[Sumatra]]". It urged the parties responsible for the haze to take preventive actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eco-business.com/news/name-and-shame-companies-behind-haze-singapore/ |newspaper=Eco-Business |title=Name and shame companies behind haze: Singapore |date=19 June 2013 |last=Cheam |first=Jessica }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenpeace also called on big palm oil companies such as Malaysia-based [[Sime Darby]] and Singapore-based [[Wilmar International]] to check whether their suppliers were involved in the burning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/press/releases/Palm-oil-companies-must-come-clean-on-Indonesian-fire-hotspots---Greenpeace/ | title=Palm oil companies must come clean on Indonesian fire hotspots (Press release) | publisher=Greenpeace. | date=22 June 2013 | accessdate=22 June 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705221804/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/press/releases/Palm-oil-companies-must-come-clean-on-Indonesian-fire-hotspots---Greenpeace/ | archive-date=5 July 2013 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with previous haze events in Southeast Asia==
Forest and land fires have been an annual occurrence in Sumatra in recent history. In the period from 2006 to 2013, the cumulative hotspot count in 2013 was the fifth highest. There were more hotspots in 2012, 2006, 2007 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cumulative Hotspot Count Charts|url=http://www.weather.gov.sg/wip/c/portal/layout?p_l_id=PUB.1003.613|publisher=ASEAN Specialised Metrological Centre|accessdate=16 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222053810/http://www.weather.gov.sg/wip/c/portal/layout?p_l_id=PUB.1003.613|archive-date=22 February 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record-breaking pollution levels in Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia in June 2013 were caused by a combination of a spike in hotspots in Sumatra and wind patterns which directed the smoke towards Singapore and Malaysia during that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wind, not big increase in forest fires, driving haze in Singapore |url=http://news.mongabay.com/2013/0626-singapore-wind-wri.html|publisher=Mongabay|accessdate=16 February 2014|date=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were more than 8,000 fire alerts in Sumatra in June 2013. Over the past 12 years, there have only been three other months with more than 8,000 fire alerts – all of which occurred in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Data Shows Indonesian Forest Fires a Longstanding Crisis|url=http://www.wri.org/blog/new-data-shows-indonesian-forest-fires-longstanding-crisis|publisher=World Resources Institute|accessdate=16 February 2014|first=Nigel |last=Sizer|first2=Kemen |last2=Austin|first3=Ariana |last3=Alisjahbana|first4=Fred |last4=Stolle|first5=James |last5=Anderson|date=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2009 Southeast Asian haze''' was an episode of large scale [[air pollution]] primarily caused by [[slash and burn]] practices used to clear land for agricultural purposes in [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]]. It affected the areas surrounding the [[Straits of Malacca]] which besides Indonesia include [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]].

The haze began in early June 2009 and progressively became worse toward July. With a prevailing dry season caused by [[El Nino]], burning and hence the haze was expected to continue until August or September when the [[monsoon]] season arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Indonesia forest fires flare, Malaysia hit by haze | publisher=Reuters | date=12 June 2009 | url=http://in.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idINTRE55B1BX20090612?sp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2015 Southeast Asian haze''' was an [[air pollution]] crisis affecting several countries in [[Southeast Asia]], including [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]] (especially its islands of [[Sumatra]] and [[Borneo]]), [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], southern [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]] and the [[Philippines]].

The haze affected [[Indonesia]] from at least late June,&lt;ref name=June15&gt;{{cite web|title=Haze envelopes parts of Riau province in Indonesia|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/haze-envelopes-parts-of-riau-province-in-indonesia|work=[[The Straits Times]]|accessdate=11 October 2015|date=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the end of October, turning into an international problem for other countries in September.

On 4 September 2015, the [[Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management]] stated that six Indonesian provinces had declared a [[state of emergency]] due to the haze; these were [[Riau]], [[Jambi]], [[South Sumatra]], [[West Kalimantan]], [[Central Kalimantan]] and [[South Kalimantan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oktama|first1=Carla Isati|title=Six Provinces Declare State of Emergency as Haze Worsens|url=http://jakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/featured-2/six-provinces-declare-state-emergency-haze-worsens|work=[[The Jakarta Globe]]|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 September, a state of emergency was again declared in [[Riau]], this time by the [[Government of Indonesia|Indonesian government]].&lt;ref name="worsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chokes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/9/14/indonesia-declares-emergency-in-haze-hit-riau-province.html|title=Indonesia declares emergency as brush-fire smoke chokes region|publisher=Al Jazeera America|date=14 September 2015|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of residents of [[Pekanbaru]], Riau's capital, fled to the nearby cities of [[Medan]] and [[Padang]].&lt;ref name="Wahyudi Soeriaatmadja"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/thousands-flee-pekanbaru-as-haze-hits-record-high|title=Thousands flee Pekanbaru as haze hits record high|author=Wahyudi Soeriaatmadja|publisher=The Straits Times|date=15 September 2015|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AsiaOne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/asia/jakarta-declares-emergency-riau-over-haze|title=Jakarta declares emergency in Riau over haze|publisher=AsiaOne|date=15 September 2015|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 October, the [[Pollutant Standards Index]] (PSI) hit a record high of 1801, recorded in the province of Central Kalimantan.&lt;ref name=I2300&gt;{{cite web|last1=Soeriaatmadja|first1=Wahyudi|title=Thick haze grounds firefighting copters|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/thick-haze-grounds-firefighting-copters|accessdate=4 October 2015|work=[[The Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marufish.com/2015/10/24/borneo-palangkaraya-air-pollution-break-3000-points/|title=Borneo Palangkaraya Air Pollution Break 3000 points!|work=Marufish World of Disaster Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Satellite image of 2015 Southeast Asian haze - 20150924.jpg|upright=1.2|thumbnail|left|A [[NASA]] satellite image showing the extent of the haze on 24 September 2015.]]
Indonesia has struggled for years to contain forest fires, especially in the islands of [[Sumatra]] and [[Kalimantan]]. In September 2014, Indonesia ratified the [[ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution]]. It is the last ASEAN country to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.menlh.go.id/indonesia-meratifikasi-undang-undang-tentang-pengesahan-asean-agreement-on-transboundary-haze-pollution-persetujuan-asean-tentang-pencemaran-asap-lintas-batas/ |title=Indonesia Meratifikasi Undang-Undang Tentang Pengesahan Asean Agreement On Transboundary Haze Pollution (Persetujuan Asean Tentang Pencemaran Asap Lintas Batas)|language=Indonesian|publisher=Ministry of Environment, Indonesia | accessdate = 16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement calls on Indonesia to take steps to solve the problem through its own efforts or through international co-operation, or else face legal action based on the impact of the haze on its south-east Asian neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kxan.com/ap/image-of-asia-wildfire-haze-shrouds-indonesias-neighbors/ |title=Image of Asia: Wildfire haze shrouds Indonesia’s neighbors |work=The Associated Press |publisher=Kxan |date=11 September 2015 |accessdate=14 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925013203/http://kxan.com/ap/image-of-asia-wildfire-haze-shrouds-indonesias-neighbors/ |archivedate=25 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Singapore also passed laws that allow it to prosecute people and firms that contribute to the haze.&lt;ref name= "bbcCause"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34265922 |title= What causes South-East Asia's haze?| publisher =BBC | work = News |date=16 September 2015|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early August 2015, although Cambodia, [[Laos]], Thailand, [[Myanmar]], and Vietnam met to discuss the haze problem, Indonesia did not join the talks.&lt;ref name="khmer hit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khmertimeskh.com/news/16585/indonesian-haze-may-be-choking-cambodia/|title=Indonesian Haze May be Choking Cambodia|author=Jonathan Cox|publisher=Khmer Times|date=6 October 2015|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Causes ===
The fires are caused by firms and farmers engaging in illegal [[slash-and-burn]] practices as a relatively inexpensive means to clear their land of unwanted vegetation and peat. Sumatra and Kalimantan possess large areas of [[peatland]], which is highly combustible during [[dry season]]. [[Peat]], which is made up of layers of dead vegetation and other organic matter, contributed heavily to carbon emissions because of the substance's high density&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Peatland Fires Biggest Contributor to Carbon Emissions: Researcher |newspaper =Jakarta Globe| url =http://jakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/environment/peatland-fires-biggest-contributor-carbon-emissions-scientist/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; and carbon content. The haze was particularly severe in 2015 due to the [[El Niño]] phenomenon, which caused drier conditions, causing the fires to spread more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dw.com/en/why-southeast-asias-haze-problem-persists/a-18715535 |title = Why South-east Asia's haze problem persists | first =Gabriel | last = Domínguez| work =Deutsche Welle|date= 15 September 2015|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published in the [[Environmental Research Letters]] stated that 59% of fire emissions in Sumatra and 73% in Kalimantan originated from "outside timber and palm oil concession boundaries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.todayonline.com/world/getting-facts-right-indonesias-haze-problems |title=Getting the facts right on Indonesia’s haze problems | first =Erik | last = Meijaard |work= The Jakarta Globe| publisher = Today Online|date=14 September 2015 |accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental rights activists added that [[palm oil]] activities were still involved in the burning.  Firstly, land clearing by burning is cheap and is more often chosen by companies than any other land-clearing method. Secondly, most companies want to avoid spending money on [[reforestation]]. Any company which obtains a license for forest lands must replant them from a fund provided by the government.&lt;ref name= "motives"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://en.tempo.co/read/news/2015/09/16/055701104/Former-Riau-Police-Chief-Reveals-Three-Motives-for-Forest-Burning|title=Former Riau Police Chief Reveals Three Motives for Forest Burning|author=Arkhelaus Wisnu|publisher=Tempo|date=16 September 2015|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most companies do not replant, and to avoid detection, they burn the land. Thirdly, the companies revitalise palm plantations by cutting or burning old palm trees that are no longer productive. The regulation stipulates that such burning must be done on a bed of concrete to avoid spreading the fire, but to reduce costs, most companies do not do this.&lt;ref name="motives"/&gt;

== Countries affected ==
At least six of the ten countries in the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] region have been affected by the haze: southern [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.astroawani.com/malaysia-news/haze-netizens-four-countries-share-their-gripe-73010|title=Haze: Netizens from four countries share their gripe|author1=Kohilah Sekaran|author2=Syafique Shuib|publisher=Astro Awani|date=12 September 2015|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thai affected"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/environment/679996/haze-blocks-out-hat-yai-trang|title=Haze blocks out Hat Yai, Trang|author=DPA|publisher=Bangkok Post|date=4 September 2015|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="viet affected"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tuoitrenews.vn/society/30851/indonesia-forest-fires-to-blame-for-foggy-ho-chi-minh-city-expert|title=Indonesia forest fires to blame for foggy Ho Chi Minh City: expert|publisher=Tuổi Trẻ|date=7 October 2015|accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most parts of [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Singapore]]. The haze affecting [[Cambodia]] and [[Cebu]] in the [[Philippines]] was also suspected to have arisen from Indonesian rather than local sources.&lt;ref name="khmer hit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PH suspects"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/107954-philippines-suspects-haze-indonesia-fires|title=Philippines suspects week-long haze from Indonesia fires|work=Agence France-Presse|date=3 October 2015|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 September 2015, the [[International Business Times|IBTimes]] published interactive before-and-after photos that showed the dramatically reduced visibility in [[Singapore]] and Indonesia due to haze.&lt;ref name=IBTimesPhotos&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore and Indonesia haze: Interactive before-and-after photos show dramatically reduced visibility|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/singapore-indonesia-haze-interactive-before-after-photos-show-dramatically-reduced-visibility-1521643|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Global Fire Emissions Database]] reported that the 2015 Indonesian fires had generated around 600 million tonnes of [[greenhouse gas]]es, an amount described as 'roughly equivalent to Germany's entire annual output'. [[NASA]] said that the 2015 haze crisis could become the worst one recorded in the region, possibly outstripping [[1997 Southeast Asian haze|the 1997 crisis]], which cost an estimated nine billion US dollars.&lt;ref name="nasa warns"&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesian fires sending haze across south-east Asia could become worst on record, NASA warns|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-02/indonesia-forest-fires-could-become-worst-on-record-nasa-warns/6824460|publisher=[[ABC Online]]|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smoke from forest fires in [[Kalimantan]], blown by prevailing south-westerly winds, brought hazy conditions to [[Brunei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://englishnews.thaipbs.or.th/brunei-haze-may-last-for-a-week|title=Brunei haze may last for a week|work=The Brunei Times|publisher=Thai PBS|date=26 August 2015|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A duty forecaster at the Brunei Meteorological Department, Nurulinani Haji Jahari, said heavy thunderstorms would do little to relieve the hazy conditions because westerly winds were still expected to continue bringing more smoke from [[Kalimantan]] and Sumatra. On 15 September, the [[Tutong District]] recorded an all-time-high [[Pollutant Standards Index]] (PSI) reading of 68; followed by [[Belait District|Belait]], with 67; [[Brunei-Muara District|Brunei-Muara]], with 65; and [[Temburong District|Temburong]], with 48.&lt;ref name="bru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/asia/hazy-conditions-persist-brunei-week|title=Hazy conditions to persist in Brunei this week|author=Wail Wardi Wasil|work=The Brunei Times/Asia News Network|publisher=AsiaOne|date=15 September 2015|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bruneian public were advised by authorities to drink plenty of water and seek medical assistance if experiencing smoke-related symptoms. Authorities also warned against any open burning or other activities that might worsen the haze.&lt;ref name="bru"/&gt;

=== Cambodia ===
[[Phnom Penh]] suffered from haze, and its [[Ministry of Environment (Cambodia)|Cambodian Ministry of the Environment]] suspected that fires set by plantation owners in Indonesia might be to blame. Uncertainty of the source remained since Indonesia released little relevant information.&lt;ref name="khmer hit"/&gt;

The 2015 haze affected Indonesia from at least late June, with the municipality of [[Dumai]] (in the province of Riau on the island of Sumatra) reporting haze beginning 28 June.&lt;ref name=June15/&gt; The problem persisted for months.&lt;ref name=IndonesiaSchools/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nazeer|first1=Zubaidah|title=Haze blankets parts of Sumatra|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/haze-blankets-parts-of-sumatra|work=[[The Straits Times]]|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics]], which considers a pollution index over 350 "hazardous", reported on 22 September 2015 that the index in [[Palangkaraya]] in [[Central Kalimantan]] hit 1,986 and the index for [[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]] in [[West Kalimantan]] reached 706.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rahadiana|first1=Reika|title=Haze Worsens as Smog Covers Singapore, Parts of Indonesia|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-22/haze-worsens-as-singapore-parts-of-indonesia-covered-in-smog|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]]|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These readings surpassed quintuple and double the official "hazardous" level, respectively. In late September, the province of Central Kalimantan measured a record high of 2,300 on Indonesia's PSI. On 2 October, Central Kalimantan was still experiencing a very high PSI of 1,801, such that firefighting helicopters were unable to water-bomb certain areas due to low visibility.&lt;ref name=I2300/&gt;

By mid-late October the burning hotspots, increasing sharply in number, had even spread to Indonesia's [[Papua region]]. The ''Terra Aqua'' satellite also discovered 63 hotspots in [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]] and 17 in [[North Maluku]]. 1,545 hotspots were detected in Indonesia, although the exact number couldn't be ascertained as the haze covering the region was too thick. The [[Nusa Tenggara Islands]] also had hotspots: around 67 in [[East Nusa Tenggara]] and 25 in [[West Nusa Tenggara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/indonesia/berita_indonesia/2015/10/151019_indonesia_asap_sulawesi|title=Kebakaran hutan mencapai Sulawesi, Maluku dan Papua|language=Indonesian|publisher=BBC News|date=19 October 2015|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of flights were cancelled in [[Timika]], [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]]. Both the Moluccas Islands and Sulawesi were covered by haze. In Sulawesi, around 800 hotspots were discovered by BPBD, a disaster mitigation agency. There were 57 hotspots in [[West Sulawesi]], 151 in [[South Sulawesi]], 361 in [[Central Sulawesi]], 126 in [[Southeast Sulawesi]], 47 in [[Gorontalo]] and 59 in [[North Sulawesi]]. The city of [[Palu]] was covered by haze from nearby Kalimantan, causing some flight delays.

In Java, forest fires burned in [[West Java]] and [[Mount Merapi]], [[Central Java]]. A forest fire, which trapped hikers and killed at least seven of them on [[Mount Lawu]] in [[Magetan Regency]] in [[East Java]], was later reported to have been caused by a [[bonfire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Seven Hikers Were Burned To Death In Mount Lawu|url=http://www.jawapos.com/read/2015/10/19/7589/7-pendaki-gunung-lawu-tewas-terpanggang|accessdate=21 October 2015|publisher=Jawa Pos|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident caused local areas to be evacuated. The haze in Palangkaraya was so thick that it turned the air yellow and exceeded the 'dangerous' threshold by 10 times. The annual parliamentary meeting was interrupted, as the smoke from outside entered the room, causing all of the politicians to use masks and tissues in the room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rapat Diganggu Asap, Pj Gubernur Kalteng: Parah, Perlu Bantuan Pusat!|url=http://news.detik.com/berita/3048444/rapat-diganggu-asap-pj-gubernur-kalteng-parah-perlu-bantuan-pusat|accessdate=20 October 2015|publisher=Detik.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kalimantan politicians wear facemasks inside parliament as Palangkaraya suffers in silence|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2015/10/kalimantan-politicians-wear-facemasks-inside-parliament-as-palangkaraya-suffers-in-silence/|accessdate=21 October 2015|publisher=''Mongabay.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most schools in the affected area were closed until further notice due to the haze. In Riau and [[Palembang]], students were advised to go to school only twice a week. Sometimes they did not even go to school for a whole week due to the haze, causing wide concern among parents and government officials. At least ten companies, seven of which are foreign companies, were declared as the prime suspects for fire in Sumatra and Kalimantan. Two of the companies' certificates were suspended by the government. Indonesian president [[Joko Widodo]] ordered all hospitals and ''[[puskesmas]]'' (community health clinics) to be open for 24 hours. On 20 October, there were 825 new hotspots in Sumatra, with the visibility in Riau deteriorating to 50 meters. Around 66 flights in Pekanbaru were cancelled. At noon, the haze worsened as the air became yellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Help, Thick Smoke Surrounding Pekanbaru|url=http://news.detik.com/berita/3049389/tolong-asap-pekat-menguning-kepung-pekanbaru|accessdate=21 October 2015|publisher=Detik.com|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government of Riau, later made a statement that the haze crisis has killed their citizens slowly by suffocating them.

On 21 October, it was reported that the number of people with respiratory problems had risen to 78,829 in Riau alone. Many reported they suffered from dizziness and sore eyes. Most of the victims killed by the haze were students and newborn babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/indonesia/berita_indonesia/2015/10/151002_indonesia_baby_shelter_haze|title=Apa pemerintah menunggu anak-anak kami mati karena asap?|language=Indonesian|publisher=BBC News|date=2 October 2015|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nine-year-old third-grade student died because of the smoke and the doctors and nurses who tried to save the child reported that the child's lungs were fully filled with smoke. A 15-month-old baby also died in Jambi. The photos of the dead body, taken with the baby's mother, went viral on [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/indonesia/107935-bayi-meninggal-kabut-asap-jambi|title=Satu lagi bayi meninggal karena kabut Asap|language=Indonesian|publisher=Rappler|date=3 October 2015|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foto Bayi Meninggal Akibat Kabut Asap Ramai di Medsos|url=http://news.okezone.com/read/2015/10/02/340/1224950/foto-bayi-meninggal-akibat-kabut-asap-ramai-di-medsos|accessdate= 30 September 2015|publisher=''Okezone''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The haze crisis also interrupted the search for a missing [[Eurocopter EC130]] with five people on board in [[Lake Toba]]. The sole survivor reported that the cause of the crash was the haze.

=== Philippines ===
As of 3 October, the [[Philippine]] island of [[Cebu]] suffered its seventh straight day of haze. Therefore, it was suspected, although not confirmed, that the haze was originating from Indonesian and not local sources, possibly as a result of monsoon winds blowing north-east from fires in Indonesia towards the direction of the central [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="PH suspects"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/indon-haze-blankets-cebu/221983/|title=Indon haze blankets Cebu|publisher=The Manila Times|date=3 October 2015|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, some [[Philippine]] aircraft had difficulties landing at the [[Mactan–Cebu International Airport]].

Vestil|author2=Elias O.

The interaction made a pocket of air above Cebu where a visible haze accumulated. Bagtasa said that the haze had already reached the island of [[Mindanao]] and other parts of [[Visayas]] when it was reported in Cebu but was too thin to be visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dimacali|first1=TJ|title=Why only in Cebu?

By mid-October, haze from Indonesia had reached [[Mindanao]]. On 20 October, it was reported that the [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]] (PAGASA) in Southern Mindanao had been monitoring the haze for days. The weather body said that haze had been visible in Davao City since 17 October. [[Typhoon Koppu (2015)|Typhoon Koppu]] and the [[amihan|north-east monsoon]] were linked to the haze affecting Mindanao. Haze was also reported in the cities of [[Cagayan de Oro]], [[General Santos]], [[Iligan]], [[Davao City|Davao]], and [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Manlupig|first1=Karlos|title=Haze from Indonesia blankets Mindanao cities|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/732736/haze-from-indonesia-blankets-mindanao-cities|accessdate=21 October 2015|agency=Inquirer Mindanao|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=20 October 2015|location=Davao City}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia haze reaches cities in Mindanao|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/110051-indonesia-haze-cities-mindanao-philippines|accessdate=21 October 2015|publisher=Rappler|date=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thunderstorms and rain had improved the situation in the afternoons of the 15th and 16th, while a change in prevailing wind direction improved the situation from the 20th to the 22nd.

The haze deteriorated again on the evening of the 23rd and the morning of the 24th as denser haze from Sumatra was blown into the country by prevailing southerly winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/haze-conditions-may-worsen-on-thursday-24-hour-psi-may-cross-into-very|title=Haze worsens on Thursday, 24-hour PSI edges into very unhealthy range|author=Lee Min Kok|publisher=The Straits Times|date=24 September 2015|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 September, the PSI reading at 7 p.m. rose into the "hazardous" range for the first time in 2015 with a reading of 313. It rose further to 317 at 8 p.m., which prompted the [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|Ministry of Education (MOE)]] to close all primary and secondary schools on the 25th due to the worsening haze conditions.&lt;ref name=SingaporeSchools/&gt; The haze deteriorated further during the small hours, reaching a record high for the year at 5 a.m. with a reading of 341. However, the 3-hour PSI quickly fell back into the "moderate" range at 1 p.m. the next day. The PSI had been hovering at the unhealthy range from the late afternoon to the evening, and the MOE announced schools to reopen on 28 September 2015. Since that day, PSI levels have remained at the unhealthy range, even rising up to very unhealthy on a few occasions.&lt;ref name=hazegovsg&gt;{{cite web|title=NEA haze readings for past 24 hours (refreshed daily)|url=http://www.nea.gov.sg/anti-pollution-radiation-protection/air-pollution-control/psi/psi-readings-over-the-last-24-hours|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150925122632/http://www.nea.gov.sg/anti-pollution-radiation-protection/air-pollution-control/psi/psi-readings-over-the-last-24-hours|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 September 2015|publisher=National Environment Agency, Singapore|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 September 2015, [[Ministry of Manpower (Singapore)|Ministry of Manpower]] (MOM) lodged a police report over a [[Hoaxes in Singapore|hoax]] post on social media ([[WhatsApp]] and [[Facebook]]) that claimed it had declared a "[[2015 Voluntary non-work day|voluntary non-work day]]" on Friday, 25 September 2015 as a result of the haze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MOM lodges police report over hoax post|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/mom-lodges-police-report-over-hoax-post|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haze &amp; confused|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/haze-confused|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tnp"&gt;{{cite web|title=MOM debunks fake 'voluntary non-work day' Facebook post|url=http://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore-news/mom-debunks-fake-voluntary-non-work-day-facebook-post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 2015, the government, for the first time, named five firms: [[Asia Pulp and Paper]], [[Rimba Hutani Mas]], [[Sebangun Bumi Andalas Wood Industries]], [[Bumi Sriwijaya Sentosa]] and [[Wachyuni Mandira]] as responsible for the haze and instructed them to take measures to extinguish fires on their land, not to start new ones, and to submit action plans on how they would prevent future fires. The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources stressed that the haze was a man-made problem that should not be tolerated. Under Singapore's Transboundary Haze Pollution Act, those guilty can be fined up to $100,000 a day, capped at $2 million, for causing unhealthy haze.

Some of the [[2015 FINA Swimming World Cup]]'s events on 3 October 2015 were cancelled as the PSI was in the 'unhealthy' range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FINA Swimming World Cup finals cancelled due to haze|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/fina-swimming-world-cup/2167788.html|publisher=[[Channel News Asia]]|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October 2015, the 1-hour PM2.5 concentration reached a record high of 471μg/m³ for the West region at 11 p.m., while the South region was at 301μg/m³ . This was a sharp increase as the highest 1-hour PM2.5 concentration in Singapore at 9 p.m. was 164μg/m³ . The [[National Environment Agency]] attributed this to "denser haze from the sea areas south of Singapore being blown in by the prevailing south-south=easterly winds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PM2.5 levels hit 471 as haze situation worsens|url=http://www.todayonline.com/world/asia/pm25-levels-hit-471-haze-situation-worsens|work=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thunderstorms in the morning of 28 October 2015 brought respite from the haze when the PSI dropped from 61 to 26 at 9 a.m.

The National Environment Agency (NEA) announced that they would stop issuing daily haze advisories from 15 November 2015 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haze Situation Update (15 November 2015)|url=http://www.nea.gov.sg/corporate-functions/newsroom/advisories/haze-situation-update-15-november-2015|website=National Environment Agency|publisher=Government of Singapore|accessdate=18 June 2017|date=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 haze crisis in Singapore was considered as the most serious haze episode for Singapore as it lasted for a long time. It was also the first time the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) deployed a Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) Chinook helicopter and 34 SAF personnel to help fight the ongoing forest fires in Sumatra, Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/saf-and-scdf-teams-set-off-to-help-fight-haze-fires-in-indonesia|title=SAF and SCDF teams set off to help fight haze fires in Indonesia|last=|first=|date=2015-10-10|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thailand ===
The haze from [[Sumatra]] turned most parts of southern Thailand such as [[Narathiwat Province|Narathiwat]], [[Pattani Province|Pattani]], [[Phuket Province|Phuket]], [[Satun Province|Satun]], [[Songkhla Province|Songkhla]], [[Surat Thani Province|Surat Thani]], [[Trang Province|Trang]] and [[Yala Province|Yala]] provinces unsightly, even reaching hazardous levels on 7 October&lt;ref name="thai affected"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thephuketnews.com/sumatra-forest-fire-haze-returns-to-blanket-phuket-53945.php|title=Sumatra forest fire haze returns to blanket Phuket|author=Saroj Kueprasertkij|publisher=The Phuket News|date=4 September 2015|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rg co-operate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asean/720720/pm-calls-for-regional-haze-cooperation|title=PM calls for regional haze cooperation|publisher=Bangkok Post|date=7 October 2015|accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/720160/smoke-haze-hazardous-in-three-southern-provinces|title=Smoke haze hazardous in three southern provinces|publisher=Bangkok Post|date=6 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phuket Provincial Health Office (PPHO) issued a health advisory to its residents in August 2015 and in October the province saw a number of flight delays in [[Phuket Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thephuketnews.com/phuket-health-advisory-issued-over-forest-fire-haze-53838.php|title=Phuket health advisory issued over forest fire haze|author1=Saroj Kueprasertkij|author2=Tanyaluk Sakoot|publisher=The Phuket News|date=27 August 2015|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thethaiger.com/news/phuket/Haze-causes-delays-flights-Phuket-Airport|title=Haze causes more delays for flights at Phuket Airport|author=Kritsada Mueanhawong|publisher=Phuket Gazette|date=8 October 2015|accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The air quality index in provinces of southern Thailand were increasing with the Regional Environmental Office Director Halem Jehmarikan saying the current air pollution levels were the result of the wind direction and a low pressure area, preventing the haze from being blown away. A number of hospitals saw an increase in child patients with respiratory system related symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eco-business.com/news/thailand-southern-haze-hits-this-years-worst/|title=Thailand: Southern haze hits this year's worst|work=National News Bureau of Thailand|publisher=Eco Business|date=5 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halem also added the pollution was the worst in decades compared to previous smog that faded within four hours.&lt;ref name="war room"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Haze-in-South-rises-beyond-safety-mark-30270267.html|title=Haze in South rises beyond safety mark|publisher=The Nation|date=6 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vietnam ===
[[Ho Chi Minh City]] and other provinces in Southern Vietnam were enveloped in haze as of 4 October. Vietnamese experts believe that the phenomenon was partly caused by the fire in Indonesia. According to the southern unit of the Vietnamese National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, many provinces and cities in the [[Mekong Delta]], such as [[Sóc Trăng]], [[Cà Mau]], [[Kiến Giang]], [[Đồng Tháp Province|Đồng Tháp]], [[Bến Tre Province|Bến Tre]], and [[Cần Thơ]] also experienced similar foggy weather since the beginning of October.&lt;ref name="viet affected"/&gt; Residents were told to stay indoors as southern Vietnam saw a rising number of child patients suffering irritated eyes, nosebleeds, runny noses, and sneezing. The haze was predicted to continue for three days before being gradually eased by heavy rains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/society/143553/dry-haze-sends-rising-number-of-southern-children-to-hospitals.html|title=Dry haze sends rising number of southern children to hospitals|publisher=Vietnam Net|date=9 October 2015|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Counter-measures ==

=== Firefighting ===

Both Indonesia and Malaysia started daily [[cloud seeding]] on 15 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysia-and-indonesia-begin-cloud-seeding-to-fight-haze-how-cloud-seeding-works|title=Malaysia and Indonesia begin cloud seeding to fight haze: How cloud seeding works|author=Chew Hui Min|publisher=The Straits Times|date=15 September 2015|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cloud seeding done daily|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/malaysia/cloud-seeding-done-daily|accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen helicopters were deployed by Indonesian authorities to dump water on fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan, and cloud seeding aircraft were deployed to Kalimantan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Regional/2015/09/15/Indonesia-fights-blazes-Helicopters-water-bomb-hotspots-in-Sumatra/|title=Indonesia fights blazes|work=Agence France-Presse|publisher=The Star|date=15 September 2015|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Malaysia, the cloud seeding operation was carried out for 10 days until 25 September in areas such as [[Kuching]], [[Sri Aman]], [[Kota Samarahan]] and [[Sarikei]] in Malaysian Borneo and [[Klang Valley]] in peninsular Malaysia.&lt;ref name="cs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2015/09/15/cloud-seeding-operations-begin-today/|title=Cloud seeding operations begin today *updated*|author=Geryl Ogilvy Ruekeith|publisher=The Borneo Post|date=15 September 2015|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/09/15/malaysia-to-begin-cloud-seeding-as-schools-shut-due-to-haze|title=Haze forces school closures in Malaysia, with officials to try cloud-seeding to induce rain|work=Associated Press|publisher=US News|date=15 September 2015|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indonesian government also started building [[retention basin]]s to restore moisture to the peatland in Sumatra and Kalimantan. Dry peatland, due to the dry season and also drainage for oil palm cultivation, was cited as the reason that fire spread quickly. Retention basins were built by blocking water flow in drainage canals, and the re-wetted peatland would serve to check the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/07/15/after-peat-fires-riau-shows-down-earth-approach-ending-haze.html|title=After the peat fires, Riau shows down-to-earth approach to ending haze|author=Warief Djajanto Basorie|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date=15 July 2014|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/presidenID/posts/459759717546216|title=Joko Widodo recent activities in Facebook|author=Joko Widodo|publisher=Facebook|date=10 October 2015|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Singapore and Malaysia''' have a long-standing [[water conflict|conflict]] over [[water supply|water supplies]].

In ensuring sufficient water supply in the rapidly modernising colonial city of Singapore in the 1920s, in 1927, the municipal leadership of Singapore and Sultan Ibrahim of the state and territories of [[Johor]] in neighboring [[British Malaya|Malaya]] signed an agreement that allowed Singapore to rent land in Johor and use its water for free. The Municipal Water Department of Singapore, under [[David J. Murnane]], began importing raw water from Gunong Pulai in 1927 and filtered water on 31 December 1929. Since then, several water agreements had been signed between two countries.

{{TOC right}}

==History==
===20th century===
The first water agreement was signed between [[Ibrahim of Johor|Sultan Ibrahim II]] the [[Sultan of Johor]] and the Municipal Commissioners of the Town of Singapore on 5 December 1927, under the [[Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements]]. It is no longer in force.

On 1 September 1961, the [[Federation of Malaya]] signed an agreement giving Singapore the right to draw up to {{convert|86|e6impgal|m3}} of water per day collectively from the [[Tebrau River]], the [[Skudai River]], the [[Pontian District|Pontian]] Reservoir, and the [[Mount Pulai|Gunung Pulai]] Reservoir, with effect through 2011. On 29 September 1962, a further agreement was signed providing Singapore the right to draw up to {{convert|250|e6impgal|m3}} per day from the [[Johor River]], with effect until 2061. Both agreements stipulated the price of 3 Malaysian cents per {{convert|1,000|impgal|L}}.

In 1994, Linggiu Reservoir was built upstream of the Johor River and collects and releases rainwater. This pushes seawater back into the sea, ensuring that the river water is not too salty to be treated. It is operated by the [[Public Utilities Board]] (PUB) of Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;"Finding ways to increase water supply from Johor River", The Straits Times, 17 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
The Malaysian government has stated{{when|date=December 2013}} that the agreements were signed in a different time and that the price should increase. It cites the example of water sold by China to Hong Kong in the past, which was approximately US$5.8 per {{convert|1,000|impgal|L}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsd.gov.hk/filemanager/common/annual_report/2010_11/pdf/07.pdf Water Supplies Department of Hong Kong Annual Report 2010/11 - Optimising Water Supplies (3.11MB)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this price comparison is not directly applicable because while Hong Kong has borne the cost of constructing the infrastructure and China has borne the cost of maintaining to provide water to Hong Kong, Singapore paid for all the costs of the reservoirs in Johor, the dams, pipelines, plant, equipment, etc., and Singapore paid all costs of operating and maintaining the infrastructure.

On 31 August 2011, the 2011 water agreement expired, and the waterworks and facilities were handed over to the Johor state government. The handover included the Skudai and Gunung Pulai water treatment plants, which were built by the [[Public Utilities Board]] and managed by them for 50 years, as well as two pump houses in [[Pontian District|Pontian]] and [[Tebrau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_707886.html |title=1961 water agreement with Johor expires on Wednesday |publisher=[[The Straits Times]] |accessdate=14 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922211108/http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_707886.html |archivedate=22 September 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 June 2018, Malaysian Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamed]] stated his intentions of renegotiating the agreement with Singapore as he views the low price at which water is being exported to Singapore has resulted in Malaysia losing a significant amount of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mahathir-water-malaysia-singapore-deal-too-costly-renegotiate-10466390|title=Water supply deal with Singapore ‘too costly’, needs to be settled: Malaysia PM Mahathir|website=Channel NewsAsia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aral Sea''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|r|əl}})&lt;ref&gt;https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/aral_sea&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[endorheic basin|endorheic lake]] (one with no outflow) lying between [[Kazakhstan]] ([[Aktobe Region|Aktobe]] and [[Kyzylorda Region]]s) in the north and [[Uzbekistan]] ([[Karakalpakstan]] autonomous region) in the south. The name roughly translates as "Sea of Islands", referring to over 1,100 islands that had dotted its waters; in the [[Turkic languages]] ''aral'' means "island, archipelago". The Aral Sea [[drainage basin]] encompasses Uzbekistan and parts of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan and Iran.&lt;ref name=aral.unece.org&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/water/blanks/assessment/aral.pdf|title=DRAINAGE BASIN OF THE ARAL SEA AND OTHER TRANSBOUNDARY SURFACE WATERS IN CENTRAL ASIA|website=United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)|date= 2005|accessdate= 4 Feb 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly the fourth-[[largest lake]] in the world with an area of {{convert|68,000|km2|sqmi|-2|abbr=on}}, the Aral Sea has been shrinking since the 1960s after the rivers that fed it were diverted by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] irrigation projects. By 1997, it had declined to 10% of its original size, splitting into four lakes: the [[North Aral Sea]], the eastern and western basins of the once far larger [[South Aral Sea]], and one smaller intermediate lake.&lt;ref name="sciam"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Philip Micklin |author2=Nikolay V.

[[UNESCO]] added the historical documents concerning the development of the Aral Sea to its [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World Register]] as a unique resource to study this "environmental tragedy".

==Formation==
Geographer [[Nick Middleton]] believes that the [[Amu Darya]] did not flow into the shallow depression that now forms the Aral Sea until the beginning of the [[Holocene]],&lt;ref name="physical1"&gt;Middleton, Nick; "The Aral Sea" in Shahgedanova Maria; ''The Physical Geography of Northern Eurasia''; pp. 497-498&lt;/ref&gt; and it is known that the Amu Darya flowed into the [[Caspian Sea]] via the [[Uzboy channel]] until the Holocene.&lt;ref name="physical1"/&gt; The Syr Darya formed a large lake in the [[Kyzyl Kum]] during the [[Pliocene]] known as the Mynbulak depression.&lt;ref&gt;Velichko, Andrey and Spasskaya, Irina; "Climatic Change and the Development of Landscapes" in Shahgedanova Maria; ''The Physical Geography of Northern Eurasia''; pp. 48-50&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Most of the area around the Aral Sea was inhabited by desert nomads who left few written records. However, the Oxus delta to the south has a long history under the name of [[Khwarezm]]. It was once the westernmost border of [[Tang dynasty]] [[China]].

===Naval history===

[[File:Michell-Russian-steam-barges-Kungrad.jpg|thumb|Ships of Imperial Russian Navy's Aral Flotilla in the 1850s]]
Russian naval presence on the Aral Sea started in 1847, with the founding of Raimsk, which was soon renamed Fort [[Aralsk]], near the mouth of the Syr Darya. Soon, the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] started deploying its vessels on the sea. Owing to the Aral Sea basin not being connected to other bodies of water, the vessels had to be disassembled in [[Orenburg]] on the [[Ural River]], shipped overland to Aralsk (presumably by a [[camel train|camel caravan]]), and then reassembled. The first two ships, assembled in 1847, were the two-masted schooners named ''Nikolai'' and ''Mikhail''. The former was a warship; the latter was a merchant vessel meant to serve the establishment of the fisheries on the great lake. In 1848, these two vessels surveyed the northern part of the sea. In the same year, a larger warship, the ''Constantine'', was assembled. Commanded by Lt. Alexey Butakov ([[:ru:Бутаков, Алексей Иванович|Алексей Бутаков]]), the ''Constantine'' completed the survey of the entire Aral Sea over the next two years.&lt;ref name=michell&gt;{{Cite book|first1= Chokan Chingisovich |last1=Valikhanov |first2= Mikhail Ivanovich |last2=Venyukov |publisher=Edward Stanford |location=London |year=1865 |title=The Russians in Central Asia: their occupation of the Kirghiz steppe and the line of the Syr-Daria: their political relations with Khiva, Bokhara, and Kokan: also descriptions of Chinese Turkestan and Dzungaria |others= Translated by John Michell, Robert Michell |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924023159621 |pages=324–329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the navigation season of 1851, two newly built steamers arrived from Sweden, again by caravan from Orenburg. As the geological surveys had found no coal deposits in the area, the Military Governor-General of Orenburg [[Vasily Perovsky]] ordered "as large as possible supply" of saxaul (''[[Haloxylon ammodendron]]'', a desert shrub, akin to the [[creosote bush]]) to be collected in Aralsk for use by the new steamers. Unfortunately, saxaul wood did not turn out a very suitable fuel, and in the later years, the Aral Flotilla was provisioned, at substantial cost, by coal from the [[Donbass]].&lt;ref name=michell/&gt; (This was part of the [[Russian conquest of Turkestan]].)

This was part of the Soviet plan for [[cotton]], or "white gold", to become a major export. This temporarily succeeded, and in 1988, Uzbekistan was the world's largest exporter of cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=USDA-Foreign Agriculture Service|title=Cotton Production Ranking|url= http://www.cotton.org/econ/cropinfo/cropdata/rankings.cfm|publisher=National Cotton Council of America|year=2013|accessdate=Oct 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cotton production in Uzbekistan]] is still important to the [[Economy of Uzbekistan|national economy]] of the country.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news |title=Cotton production linked to images of the dried up Aral Sea basin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-fashion-blog/2014/oct/01/cotton-production-linked-to-images-of-the-dried-up-aral-sea-basin |work=The Guardian |date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The True Costs of Cotton: Cotton Production and Water Insecurity |url=https://ejfoundation.org/resources/downloads/EJF_Aral_report_cotton_net_ok.pdf |publisher=[[Environmental Justice Foundation]] (EJF)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cotton is Uzbekistan's main cash crop, accounting for 17% of its exports in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;''Uzbekistan in Numbers 2006'', State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Tashkent, 2007 {{ru icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of irrigation canals began on a large scale in the 1940s.{{clarify||Above it says this was only decided in the 1960s?!|date=July 2014}} Many of the canals were poorly built, allowing water to leak or evaporate. From the [[Qaraqum Canal]], the largest in Central Asia, perhaps 30 to 75% of the water went to waste.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Today,{{when|date=July 2014}} only 12% of Uzbekistan's irrigation canal length is waterproofed. Of the 47,750&amp;nbsp;km of interfarm irrigation channels in the basin, only 28% have anti-infiltration linings. Only 77% of farm intakes have flow gauges, and of the 268,500&amp;nbsp;km of onfarm channels, only 21% have anti-infiltration linings, which retain on average 15% more water than unlined channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.cawater-info.net/aral/aral0_e.htm|title=ca-water.net, a knowledge base for projects in the Central Asia|year=2003|accessdate=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1960, between {{convert|20|and|60|km3|cumi|lk=out|abbr=on}} of water each year was going to the land instead of the sea. Most of the sea's water supply had been diverted, and in the 1960s, the Aral Sea began to shrink. From 1961 to 1970, the Aral's level fell at an average of {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} a year; in the 1970s, the average rate nearly tripled to {{convert|50|-|60|cm|abbr=on}} per year, and by the 1980s, it continued to drop, now with a mean of {{convert|80|-|90|cm|abbr=on}} each year. The rate of water use for irrigation continued to increase; the amount of water taken from the rivers doubled between 1960 and 2000, and cotton production nearly doubled in the same period.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The disappearance of the lake was no surprise to the Soviets; they expected it to happen long before. As early as 1964, Aleksandr Asarin at the [[Hydroproject]] Institute pointed out that the lake was doomed, explaining, "It was part of the [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plans]], approved by the [[Government of the Soviet Union|council of ministers]] and the [[Politburo]]. Nobody on a lower level would dare to say a word contradicting those plans, even if it was the fate of the Aral Sea."&lt;ref name="winse"&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael Wines|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E4DA1F3BF93AA35751C1A9649C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Grand Soviet Scheme for Sharing Water in Central Asia Is Foundering|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2002-12-09|accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction to the predictions varied. Some Soviet experts apparently considered the Aral to be "nature's error", and a Soviet engineer said in 1968, "it is obvious to everyone that the evaporation of the Aral Sea is inevitable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bissell|first=Tom|title=Eternal Winter: Lessons of the Aral Sea Disaster|pages=41–56|publisher=Harper's|year=2002|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, starting in the 1960s, a [[Northern river reversal|large-scale project]] was proposed to redirect part of the flow of the rivers of the [[Ob River|Ob]] basin to Central Asia over a gigantic canal system. Refilling of the Aral Sea was considered as one of the project's main goals. However, due to its staggering costs and the negative public opinion in [[RSFSR|Russia proper]], the federal authorities abandoned the project by 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glantz|first= Michael H.|title=Creeping Environmental Problems and Sustainable Development in the Aral Sea...|page=174|location=Cambridge, New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=0-521-62086-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2YXnBxZg7c4C|accessdate=May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1960 to 1998, the sea's surface area shrank by about 60%, and its volume by 80%. In 1960, the Aral Sea had been the world's [[List of lakes by area|fourth-largest]] lake, with an area around {{convert|68000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and a volume of {{convert|1100|km3|cumi|abbr=on}}; by 1998, it had dropped to {{convert|28687|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and eighth largest. The salinity of the Aral Sea also increased: by 1990 it was around 376&amp;nbsp;g/L.&lt;ref name=sciam/&gt; (By comparison, the salinity of ordinary [[seawater]] is typically around 35&amp;nbsp;g/L; the [[Dead Sea]]'s salinity varies between 300 and 350&amp;nbsp;g/L.)

In 1987, the continuing shrinkage split the lake into two separate bodies of water, the [[North Aral Sea]] (the Lesser Sea, or Small Aral Sea) and the [[South Aral Sea]] (the Greater Sea, or Large Aral Sea). In June 1991, Uzbekistan gained independence from the Soviet Union. [[Craig Murray]], a UK ambassador to Uzbekistan in 2002, described the independence as a way for [[Islam Karimov]] to consolidate his power rather than a move away from a Soviet-style economy and its philosophy of exploitation of the land. Murray attributes the shrinkage of the Aral Sea in the 1990s to Karimov's cotton policy. The government maintained an enormous irrigation system which Murray described as massively wasteful, with most of the water being lost through evaporation before reaching the cotton.{{clarify|date=December 2016}} [[Crop rotation]] was not used, and the depleted soil and monoculture required massive quantities of pesticides and fertilizer. The runoff from the fields washed these chemicals into the shrinking sea, creating severe pollution and health problems. As the water supply of the Aral Sea decreased, the demand for cotton increased and the government reacted by pouring more pesticides and fertilizer onto the land. Murray compared the system to the slavery system in the pre-Civil War United States; forced labor was used, and profits were siphoned off by the powerful and well-connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dirty Diplomacy|author=Craig Murray|publisher=Scribner|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By summer 2003, the South Aral Sea was vanishing faster than predicted. In the deepest parts of the sea, the bottom waters were saltier than the top, and not mixing. Thus, only the top of the sea was heated in the summer, and it evaporated faster than would otherwise be expected. In 2003, the South Aral further divided into eastern and western basins.

In 2004, the Aral Sea's surface area was only {{convert|17160|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, 25% of its original size, and a nearly five-fold increase in salinity had killed most of its natural flora and fauna. By 2007, the sea's area had further shrunk to 10% of its original size.  The decline of the North Aral has now been partially reversed following construction of a dam (see below), but the remnants of the South Aral continue to disappear and its drastic shrinkage has created the [[Aralkum]], a desert on the former lake bed.

The inflow of groundwater into the South Aral Sea will probably not in itself be able to stop the desiccation, especially without a change in irrigation practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciesin.org/docs/006-238/006-238.html|title=Desiccation of the Aral Sea|publisher=''CIESIN, Columbia University''|author=Philip P. Micklin|year=1988|accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This inflow of about {{convert|4|km3|cumi|abbr=on}} per year is larger than previously estimated.

The receding sea has left huge plains covered with salt and toxic chemicals resulting from [[Vozrozhdeniya island#History|weapons testing]], industrial projects, and pesticides and fertilizer runoff. These substances form wind-borne toxic dust that spreads throughout the region. As a result, the land around the Aral Sea is heavily polluted, and the people living in the area are suffering from a lack of fresh water and [[public health problems in the Aral Sea region|health problems]], including high rates of certain forms of cancer and lung diseases. Respiratory illnesses, including [[tuberculosis]] (most of which is [[Drug-resistant tuberculosis|drug resistant]]) and cancer, digestive disorders, [[anaemia]], and infectious diseases are common ailments in the region.

The Aral Sea fishing industry, which in its heyday employed some 40,000 and reportedly produced one-sixth of the Soviet Union's entire fish catch, has been devastated, and former fishing towns along the original shores have become [[ship graveyard]]s. [[Aral, Kazakhstan|Aral]], originally the main fishing port, is now several miles from the sea and has seen its population decline dramatically since the beginning of the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/71781|title=Kazakhstan: Measuring the Northern Aral’s Comeback|last=Bland|first=Stephen M.|date=2015-01-27|work=EurasiaNet|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town of [[Moynaq]] in Uzbekistan had a thriving harbour and fishing industry that employed about 30,000 people;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.unicef.org/ceecis/reallives_3304.html|title=Uzbekistan: Moynaq village faces the Aral Sea disaster|publisher=[[UNICEF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; now it lies miles from the shore. Fishing boats lie scattered on the dry land that was once covered by water; many have been there for 20 years.

Also destroyed is the [[muskrat]]-trapping industry in the deltas of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya, which used to yield as many as 500,000 pelts a year.&lt;ref name="winse"/&gt;

==Solution==
===Possible environmental solutions===
Many different solutions to the problems have been suggested over the years, varying in feasibility and cost, including:

*Improving the quality of [[irrigation]] canals
*Using alternative [[cotton]] species that require less water&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Aral Sea and sustainable development|date=2013-03-25 |pmid=12793660 | volume=47 |issue=7-8 |journal=Water Sci Technol |pages=41–7 | last1 = Usmanova | first1 = RM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1994, [[Kazakhstan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Kyrgyzstan]] signed a deal to pledge 1% of their budgets to help the sea recover.

In March 2000, UNESCO presented their "Water-related vision for the Aral Sea basin for the year 2025"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001262/126259mo.pdf |title=Water-related vision for the Aral Sea Basin for the year 2025; 2000 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the second World Water Forum in The Hague. This document was criticized for setting unrealistic goals and for giving insufficient attention to the interests of the area immediately around the former lakesite, implicitly giving up on the Aral Sea and the people living on the Uzbek side of the lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indymedia.nl/nl/2007/02/42459.shtml|title=(Nederland) - UNESCO promotes unsustainable development in Central Asia|publisher=Indymedia NL|date= |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2006, the [[World Bank]]'s restoration projects, especially in the North Aral, were giving rise to some unexpected, tentative relief in what had been an extremely pessimistic picture.&lt;ref name="A Witch's Brew"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Witch's Brew |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/documentary_archive/5218248.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |date=July 2006 |accessdate=May 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213020010/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/documentary_archive/5218248.stm |archivedate=December 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aral Sea Basin programme===
The future of the Aral Sea and the responsibility for its survival are now in the hands of the five countries: [[Kazakhstan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Turkmenistan]]. In 1994, they adopted the Aral Sea Basin Programme.&lt;ref name="Shawki Barghouti 2006"&gt;{{cite report|title=Case Study of the Aral Sea Water and Environmental Management Project: an independent evaluation of the World Bank's support of regional programmes|website=[[The World Bank]]|author= Shawki Barghouti|url=http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/case-study-aral-sea-water-and-environmental-management-project-independent-evaluation-w|date=2006 |accessdate= 1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Programme's four objectives are:
*To stabilize the environment of the Aral Sea Basin
*To rehabilitate the disaster area around the sea
*To improve the management of the international waters of the Aral Sea Basin
*To build the capacity of institutions at the regional and national level to advance the programme's aims

====ASBP: Phase One====
The first phase of the plan effectively began with the first involvement from the World Bank in 1992, and was in operation until 1997.  It was ineffectual for a number of reasons, but mainly because it was focused on improving directly the land around the Aral Sea, whilst not intervening in the water usage upstream. There was considerable concern amongst the Central Asian governments, which realised the importance of the Aral Sea in the ecosystem and the economy of Central Asia, and they were prepared to cooperate, but they found it difficult to implement the procedures of the plan. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

This is due in part to a lack of co-operation among the affected people. The water flowing into the Aral Sea has long been considered an important commodity, and trade agreements have been made to supply the downstream communities with water in the spring and summer months for irrigation. In return, they supply the upstream countries with fuel during the winter, instead of storing water during the warm months for hydroelectric purposes in winter. However, very few legal obligations are binding these contracts, particularly on an international stage. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

====ASBP: Phase Two====
Phase Two of the Aral Sea Basin programme followed in 1998 and ran for five years. The main shortcomings of phase two were due to its lack of integration with the local communities involved. The scheme was drawn up by the World Bank, government representatives, and various technical experts, without consulting those who would be affected. An example of this was the public awareness initiatives, which were seen as propagandist attempts by people with little care or understanding of their situation.  These failures have led to the introduction of a new plan, funded by a number of institutions, including the five countries involved and the World Bank.

====ASBP: Phase Three====
In 1997, a new plan was conceived which would continue with the previous restoration efforts of the Aral Sea. The main aims of this phase are to improve the irrigation systems currently in place, whilst targeting water management at a local level. The largest project in this phase is the North Aral Sea Project, a direct effort to recover the northern region of the Aral Sea. The North Aral Sea Project's main initiative is the construction of a dam across the Berg Strait, a deep channel which connects the North Aral Sea to the South Aral Sea. The Kok-Aral Dam is eight miles long and has capacity for over 29 cubic kilometres of water to be stored in the North Aral Sea, whilst allowing excess to overflow into the South Aral Sea.

===North Aral Sea restoration work===
[[File:AralSea ComparisonApr2005-06.jpg|thumb|Comparison of the North Aral Sea before (below) and after (above) the construction of [[Dike Kokaral]] completed in 2005.]]
[[File:North Aral Sea 2000 and 2011.gif|thumb|Comparison of the North Aral Sea in 2000 and 2011.]]

Work is being done to restore in part the North Aral Sea. Irrigation works on the Syr Darya have been repaired and improved to increase its water flow, and in October 2003, the Kazakh government announced a plan to build [[Dike Kokaral]], a concrete dam separating the two halves of the Aral Sea. Work on this dam was completed in August 2005; since then, the water level of the North Aral has risen, and its salinity has decreased. {{As of|2006}}, some recovery of sea level has been recorded, sooner than expected.&lt;ref name=reclaim&gt;{{cite news|author=Ilan Greenberg|title=A vanished Sea Reclaims its form in Central Asia|url= http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/04/05/news/sea.php|work=[[Int.

Economically significant stocks of fish have returned, and observers who had written off the North Aral Sea as an environmental disaster were surprised by unexpected reports that, in 2006, its returning waters were already partly reviving the fishing industry and producing catches for export as far as Ukraine. The restoration reportedly gave rise to long-absent rain clouds and possible microclimate changes, bringing tentative hope to an agricultural sector swallowed by a regional [[dust storm|dustbowl]], and some expansion of the shrunken sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miraculous Catch in Kazakhstan's Northern Aral Sea|url= http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P046045/syr-darya-control-northern-aral-sea-phase-project?lang=en|publisher=The World Bank|date=June 2006|accessdate=May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The sea, which had receded almost {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the port-city of [[Aral, Kazakhstan|Aralsk]], is now a mere {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} away."

===Future of South Aral Sea===
[[File:The Shrinking Aral Sea Recovers 2010.jpg|thumb|The Aral Sea in August 2010, with part of the eastern basin reflooded from heavy snowmelt.]]
[[File:Aralsea tmo 2014231 lrg.jpg|thumb|The Aral Sea completely loses Its Eastern Lobe in August 2014]]

The South Aral Sea, half of which lies in  Uzbekistan, was largely abandoned to its fate. Only excess water from the North Aral Sea is now periodically allowed to flow into the largely dried-up South Aral Sea through a [[sluice]] in the dyke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saving a Corner of the Aral Sea|url= http://go.worldbank.org/IE3PGWPVJ0|publisher=[[The World Bank]]|date=2005-09-01|accessdate=May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Discussions had been held on recreating a channel between the somewhat improved North and the desiccated South, along with uncertain wetland restoration plans throughout the region, but political will is lacking.&lt;ref name=reclaim/&gt; Uzbekistan shows no interest in abandoning the Amu Darya river as an abundant source of cotton irrigation, and instead is moving toward oil exploration in the drying South Aral seabed.&lt;ref name=thetimes/&gt;

Attempts to mitigate the effects of [[desertification]] include planting vegetation in the newly exposed seabed; however, intermittent flooding of the eastern basin is likely to prove problematic for any development. Redirecting what little flow there is from the Amu Darya to the western basin may salvage fisheries there while relieving the flooding of the eastern basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.boku.ac.at/iwhw/onlinepublikationen/nachtnebel/EU_INTAS_0511_Rebasows/Files/Summary_report.pdf|title=The rehabilitation of the ecosystem and bioproductivity of the Aral Sea under conditions of water scarcity|format=PDF|date=August 2007|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional bodies==
The Interstate Commission for Water Coordination of Central Asia (ICWC) was formed on February 18, 1992 to formally unite the five Central Asian countries, in the hopes of solving environmental, as well as socioeconomic problems in the Aral Sea region. These five states are: the Republic of Kazakhstan; the Kyrgyz Republic; the Republic of Tajikistan; Turkmenistan; and the Republic of Uzbekistan. The River Basin Organizations (the BVOs) of the Syr Darya and Amu Darya rivers were institutions called upon by the ICWC to help manage water resources. According to the ICWC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icwc-aral.uz/strategy.htm|title=Strategies suggested for implementation|publisher=ICWC|accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the main objectives of the body are:

* River basin management
* Water allocation without conflict
* Organization of water conservation on transboundary water courses
* Interaction with hydrometeorological services of the countries on flow forecast and account
* Introduction of automation into head structures
* Regular work on ICWC and its bodies' activity advancement
* Interstate agreements preparation
* International relations
* Scientific research
* Training

The International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS) was developed on March 23, 1993, by the ICWC to raise funds for the projects under Aral Sea Basin programmes. The IFAS was meant to finance programmes to save the sea and improve on environmental issues associated with the basin's drying. This programme has had some success with joint summits of the countries involved and finding funding from the World Bank to implement projects; however, it faces many challenges, such as enforcement and slowing progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waterwiki.net/index.php/IFAS_-_International_Fund_for_Saving_the_Aral_Sea|title=IFAS|publisher=WaterWiki.net|accessdate=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vozrozhdeniya==
{{Main|Vozrozhdeniya Island}}
[[File:Modis aral.jpg|thumb|“Rebirth” Island joins the mainland in mid-2001.]]

Vozrozhdeniya (Rebirth) Island, is a former [[List of islands in lakes|island]] of the Aral Sea or [[South Aral Sea]]. Due to the ongoing shrinkage of the Aral, it became first a [[peninsula]] in mid-2001 and finally part of the [[mainland]].&lt;ref&gt;[[NASA]] Visible Earth - [http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_rec.php?id=2036 "Rebirth" Island Joins the Mainland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528155231/http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_rec.php?id=2036 |date=2010-05-28 }}, [http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_rec.php?id=4343 Aral Sea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728214310/http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_rec.php?id=4343 |date=2010-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other islands like [[Kokaral]] and [[Barsa-Kelmes]] shared a similar fate. Since the disappearance of the Southeast Aral in 2008, Vozrozhdeniya effectively no longer exists as a distinct geographical feature. The area is now shared by [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Uzbekistan]].

In 1948, a top-secret [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[bioweapons]] laboratory was established on the island, in the centre of the Aral Sea which is now [[disputed territory]] between [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]. The exact history, functions and current status of this facility are still unclear, but [[bio-agent]]s tested there included ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'', ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'', ''[[Francisella tularensis]]'', ''[[Brucella suis]]'', ''[[Rickettsia prowazekii]]'', ''[[Variola major]]'' (smallpox), ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', [[botulinum toxin]], and [[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Bozheyeva, G., Y.

Ten people there were infected, of whom three died, and a massive vaccination effort involving 50,000 inhabitants ensued (see [[Aral smallpox incident]]). The bioweapons base was abandoned in 1992 following the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union|disintegration of the Soviet Union]] the previous year. Scientific expeditions proved this had been a site for production, testing and later dumping of [[biological weapons|pathogenic weapons]]. In 2002, through a project organized by the United States and with Uzbekistan's assistance, 10 [[Bacillus anthracis|anthrax]] burial sites were decontaminated. According to the Kazakh Scientific Center for Quarantine and Zoonotic Infections, all burial sites of anthrax were decontaminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authors=Khabar Television/BBC Monitoring|title=Kazakhstan: Vozrozhdeniya Anthrax Burial Sites Destroyed|url=http://www.nti.org/d_newswire/issues/newswires/2002_11_20.html|work= Global Security Newswire|publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative|date=November 20, 2002|accessdate=May 17, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422205925/http://www.nti.org/d_newswire/issues/newswires/2002_11_20.html|archivedate=April 22, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil and gas exploration==
[[Ergash Shaismatov]], the deputy [[Prime Minister of Uzbekistan|prime minister of Uzbekistan]], announced on August 30, 2006, that the [[Uzbek government]] and an international consortium consisting of state-run [[Uzbekneftegaz]], [[LUKoil|LUKoil Overseas]], [[Petronas]], [[Korea National Oil Corporation]], and [[China National Petroleum Corporation]] signed a production-sharing agreement to explore and develop oil and gas fields in the Aral Sea, saying, "The Aral Sea is largely unknown, but it holds a lot of promise in terms of finding oil and gas. There is risk, of course, but we believe in the success of this unique project." The consortium was created in September 2005.&lt;ref name=GAS&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=10748305&amp;PageNum=0 |title=Uzbekistan, intl consortium ink deal on exploring Aral Sea |publisher=ITAR-Tass |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727223036/http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=10748305&amp;PageNum=0 |archivedate=2010-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 1, 2010, 500,000 cubic meters of gas had been extracted from the region at a depth of 3&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=DRILLING&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.registan.net/index.php/2010/06/09/aral-gas/ |title=Aral Gas |author=Michael Hancock-Parmer |publisher=[[Registan.net]] |date=2010-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611212939/http://www.registan.net/index.php/2010/06/09/aral-gas/ |archivedate=2010-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Films==
The plight of the Aral coast was portrayed in the 1989 film ''Psy'' ("Dogs") by Soviet director Dmitri Svetozarov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.kinoexpert.ru/index.asp?comm=4&amp;num=5583|title=Psy|publisher=Kino Expert|accessdate=September 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was shot on location in an actual [[ghost town]] located near the Aral Sea, showing scenes of abandoned buildings and scattered vessels.

In 2000, the MirrorMundo foundation produced a documentary film called ''[[Delta Blues (documentary film)|Delta Blues]]'' about the problems arising from the drying up of the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=November 5, 2008|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0465vGRWhQE|title=Delta Blues (in a land of cotton)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, [[BBC World]] broadcast a [[documentary film|documentary]] called ''Back From the Brink?'' made by Borna Alikhani and Guy Creasey, which showed some of the changes in the region since the introduction of the Aklak Dam.

[[Bakhtyar Khudojnazarov]]'s 2012 movie ''[[Waiting for the Sea]]'' deals with the impacts on people's life in a fishing town at the shore of the Aral Sea.

In 2012 Christoph Pasour and Alfred Diebold produced an 85-minute film with the title "From the glaciers to the Aral Sea", which shows the water management system in the Aral Sea basin and in particular the situation around the Aral Sea. The film was first screened at the 6th World Water Forum in Marseille, France, in 2012 and is now available on the website: www.waterunites-ca.org&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Videos - From the Glaciers to the Aral Sea - Water Unites |url=http://www.waterunites-ca.org/videos.html |website=www.waterunites-ca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on Alfred Diebold's YouTube channel: waterunitesca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Water Unites - From the Glaciers to the Aral Sea |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJzg6DiI_I |website=youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, [[Al Jazeera]] produced a [[documentary film]] called ''People of The Lake'', directed by Ensar Altay, describing the current situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/aljazeeraworld/2012/08/2012857324531428.html|title=People of the Lake|author=Al Jazeera World|publisher=|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, director Po Powell shot much of the footage for the [[Pink Floyd]] single "[[Louder than Words (Pink Floyd song)|Louder than Words]]" video near the remains of the Aral Sea on the border between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/premieres/pink-floyd-louder-than-words-video-20141110|title=Watch Pink Floyd's Surreal, Sun-Baked 'Louder Than Words' Video|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2016 Southeast Asian haze''' is an [[air pollution]] crisis affecting several countries in [[Southeast Asia]], including [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]].&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite web|title=The haze is back across South East Asia|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37192800|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNBC1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tan|first1=Huileng|title=Singapore air quality worsens overnight as Indonesia fire arrests jump|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/25/haze-news-singapore-air-quality-worsens-overnight-as-indonesia-fire-arrests-jump.html|publisher=[[CNBC]]|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The haze is caused by Indonesian agricultural fires in [[Sumatra]] and [[Kalimantan]].&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt; The fires are attributed to illegal [[slash-and-burn]] practices by companies and individual farmers, which remove vegetation to make way for plantations of [[palm oil]], pulp and paper.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNBC1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zaharia|first1=Marius|title=Smoke from Indonesian fires hits 'unhealthy' level in Singapore|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-indonesia-haze-idUKKCN1110L4|publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water crisis in Iran''' refers to the problems which due to the [[water scarcity]] occur in [[Iran]]. Water scarcity can be a result of two mechanisms: [[Physical water scarcity|physical (absolute) water scarcity]] and [[economic water scarcity]], where physical water scarcity is a result of inadequate natural water resources to supply a region's demand, and economic water scarcity is a result of poor management of the sufficient available water resources. Iran encounters both problems.

== Water resources ==

===Climate===
Rainfall in Iran is highly seasonal, with a rainy season between October and March, leaving the land parched for the remainder of the year. Immense seasonal variations in flow characterize Iran's rivers. For example, the [[Karun River]] in [[Khuzestan]] carries water during periods of maximum flow that is ten times the amount borne in dry periods. In numerous localities, there may be no precipitation until sudden storms, accompanied by heavy rains, dump almost the entire year's rainfall in a few days. Water shortages are compounded by the unequal distribution of water. Near the Caspian Sea, rainfall averages about 1,280&amp;nbsp;mm per year, but in the Central Plateau and in the lowlands to the south it seldom exceeds 100&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="Chapin"&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/iran/74.htm Helen Chapin Metz, ed. Iran: A Country Study.] Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1987, Chapter "Water".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water availability===
Internal renewable water resources are estimated at 128.5 billion cubic meters (BCM)/year (average for 1977–2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iran-daily.com/1388/12/2/MainPaper/3622/Page/5/Index.htm|title=Iran Daily |date= 21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surface runoff represents a total of 97.3 BCM/year, of which 5.4 BCM/year comes from drainage of the aquifers and thus needs to be subtracted from the total. [[Groundwater recharge]] is estimated at about 49.3 BCM/year, of which 12.7 BCM/year is obtained from infiltration in the river bed and also needs to be subtracted. Iran receives 6.7 BCM/year of surface water from Pakistan and some water from Afghanistan through the [[Helmand River]]. The flow of the [[Arax river]], at the border with [[Azerbaijan]], is estimated at 4.6 BCM/year. The surface runoff to the sea and to other countries is estimated at 55.9 BCM/year.&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/agl/aglw/aquastat/countries/iran/main1.htm|title=Natural Resources and Environment: Land and Water Division|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/water-resources/country-profile-87.html|title=World Resources Institute:Water Resources and Freshwater Ecosystems COUNTRY PROFILE - Iran|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per capita water availability in the pre-Islamic Revolution era was about 4,500 cubic meters. In 2009, this figure was less than 2,000 cubic meters.&lt;ref name="iran-daily.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iran-daily.com/1387/3323/html/economy.htm#s358839|title=Food Security Index at 96%|author= Sadeq Dehqan|work=Iran Daily|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502233616/http://www.iran-daily.com/1387/3323/html/economy.htm|archivedate=2 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dams===
There are 42 large dams under operation in Iran with a combined storage capacity of 33 BCM/year. These dams lose about 200 million cubic meters of storage capacity every year due to sedimentation (0.5–0.75% of their storage capacity). Most dams are multi-purpose dams for hydropower, irrigation, flood control and—in some cases—drinking water supply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waser.cn/news%20and%20announcements/waser%20Technical%20Sessions/Sedimentation%20in%20the%20Reservoir%20of%20Large%20Dams%20in1final.ppt Ministry of Energy, Water Research Institute:Sedimentation in the Reservoirs of Large Dams in Iran], 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Eram garden.JPG|thumb|right|Water in Iran is used for the irrigation and decoration of traditional gardens, such as the [[Eram Garden]] in [[Shiraz]].]]

===Water use===
The total water withdrawal was estimated at about 70 BCM in 1993, rising to 93 BCM in 2004,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries_regions/iran/index.stm|title=AQUASTAT: Iran (Islamic Republic of)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604185917/http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries_regions/iran/index.stm|archivedate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which 92% was used for agricultural purposes, 6% for domestic use and 2% for industrial use. Although this is equal to 51% of the actual available renewable water resources, annual abstraction from aquifers (57 BCM in 1993, 53 BCM in 2004) is already more than the estimated safe yield (46 BCM).&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; Of the 4.3 BCM/year in 1993 (6.2 in 2004) used for domestic purposes, 61% is supplied from surface water and 39% from groundwater.&lt;ref name="Mamoudian"&gt;Seyed Ali Mamoudian, Secretary of the IWA National Committee for Iran: "Iran. Water and wastewater management across the country", IWA Yearbook 2008, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Greater Tehran]] with its population of more than 13 million is supplied by surface water from the [[Lar Dam|Lar dam]] on the [[Lar River]] in the Northeast of the city, the [[Latyan Dam|Latyan dam]] on the [[Jajrood River]] in the North, the [[Karaj River]] in the Northwest, as well as by groundwater in the vicinity of the city. Provinces of [[Gilan]], [[Mazandaran]] and [[Isfahan]] have the highest efficiency of [[irrigation]] with 54, 52 and 42 percents respectively, and [[Khuzestan]] province has the lowest irrigation efficiency with 38 percent.&lt;ref name="iran-daily.com" /&gt; Tap water consumption in the country is 70% over and above the global average.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kayhan]]:[http://www.iran-daily.com/1388/3366/html/national.htm:''Changing Old Habits'', quoting the leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei in his 2009 Norouz message]&lt;/ref&gt; 16 BCM of water was used for power generation in 1999.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:Shazand Combined-cycle power plant.JPG|thumb|right|Gas power plant in Iran. Water use by thermal power plants is more than double domestic water use.]] As of 2014, Iran is using 70% of its total renewable freshwater, far above the upper limit of 40% recommended according to international norms.&lt;ref&gt;Bijan Rouhani &amp; Fatema Soudavar Farmanfarmaian:[http://www.payvand.com/news/14/mar/1025.html Iran's Imperiled Environment], Payvand News, January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infrastructure===
Most drinking water in Iran is supplied through modern infrastructure, such as dams, reservoirs, long-distance transmission pipelines—some of which are more than 300&amp;nbsp;km long—and deep wells. An estimated 60,000 traditional [[Qanat|Karez]]  (کاریز) systems in the plateau regions of Iran in [[Yazd]], [[Khorasan (Province)|Khorasan]] and [[Kerman]]—are still in use today for irrigation and drinking water supply in rural areas and small towns.&lt;ref name="Chapin" /&gt; The oldest and largest known Karez is in the Iranian city of [[Gonabad]] which after 2700 years still provides drinking and agricultural water to nearly 40,000 people.  Its main [[water well|well]] depth is more than 360 meters and its length is 45 kilometers. It is estimated that there are as many as 500,000 deep and shallow wells in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/agenda21/natlinfo/countr/iran/Iranwatersanitf.pdf United Nations:Freshwater and Sanitation Country Profile - The Islamic Republic of Iran], p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water pollution===
Water pollution is caused by industrial and municipal wastewater, as well as by agriculture. Concerning municipal wastewater, the bulk of collected sewage is discharged untreated and constitutes a major source of [[groundwater pollution]] and a risk to public health. In a number of cities without sanitary sewerage, households discharge their sewage through open rainwater drains.&lt;ref name="www-wds.worldbank.org"&gt;[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/05/09/000090341_20050509132811/Rendered/PDF/31984.pdf World Bank: Northern Cities Water Supply and Sanitation Project], p. 29-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water crisis==
In December 2013, [[Hamid Chitchian]], head of the [[Iranian ministry of Energy|Ministry of Energy]], which is in charge of regulating the water sector—stated that the sector's situation had reached "critical levels". He correctly established that past approaches, which mainly focused on constructing dams and trying to increase the storage capacity, would no longer be appropriate remedies. In fact, total storage capacity behind the country's many dams amounts to 68 billion cubic meters, whereas the water potential of the country's rivers totals 46 billion cubic meters per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/05/iran-water-crisis.html##ixzz36gjspMJH|title=Iran sinks in water crisis|date=3 May 2014|publisher=al-monitor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, [[Issa Kalantari]], the Minister of Agricultural under [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani|president Hashemi Rafsanjani]], told Ghanoon newspaper that the water crisis is the "main problem that threatens" Iran, adding that it is more dangerous "than Israel, USA or political fighting among the Iranian elite". If the water issue is not addressed, Iran could become "uninhabitable". If this situation is not reformed, in 30 years Iran will be a [[ghost town]]. Even if there is precipitation in the [[desert]], there will be no yield, because the area for [[groundwater]] will be dried and water will remain at ground level and [[evaporate]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2013/07/irans-water-crisis-a-bigger-threat-than-israel/|title=Iran's Water Crisis: A Bigger Threat Than Israel?|first=Zachary|last=Keck|work=The Diplomat|date=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 United Nations report stated that "Water shortages are acute; agricultural livelihoods no longer sufficient. With few other options, many people have left, choosing uncertain futures as migrants in search of work". Some analysts believe the water crisis may have been a significant contributor to the [[2017–18 Iranian protests|protests around January 2018]]. At least five protesters were allegedly shot in January 2018 in [[Qahderijan]], where water rights were reportedly the main grievance. {{As of|March 2018}}, small and intermittent water protests have continued to occur in some rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sengupta|first1=Somini|title=Warming, Water Crisis, Then Unrest: How Iran Fits an Alarming Pattern|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/climate/water-iran.html|accessdate=14 April 2018|work=The New York Times|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dehghanpisheh|first1=Babak|title=Water crisis spurs protests in Iran|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-security-water-crisis/water-crisis-spurs-protests-in-iran-idUSKBN1H51A5|accessdate=14 April 2018|work=U.S.|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 10, 2018 in a video, Israel’s Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu]] announced launching a [[Persian language|Farsi]] (Persian) website which will help Iranian people to handle water crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/news/429352-israel-iran-water-crisis/|title=‘We are with you’: Netanyahu offers to help Iranians overcome water crisis in apparent PR stunt|work=RT International|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jilin chemical plant explosions''' were a series of [[explosion]]s which occurred on November 13, 2005, in the No.101 [[Petrochemical industry|Petrochemical Plant]] in [[Jilin City]], [[Jilin]] Province, [[People's Republic of China|China]], over the period of an hour. The explosions killed six, injured dozens, and caused the [[emergency evacuation|evacuation]] of tens of thousands of residents.

== Explosions ==
The cause of the blasts was initially determined two days after the blast: the accident site is a nitration unit for [[aniline]] equipment. T-102 tower jammed up and was not handled properly, hence the blasts.&lt;ref name=peoplesdaily&gt;{{cite news | url = http://english.people.com.cn/200511/15/eng20051115_221428.html | title = Five dead, one missing, nearly 70 injured after chemical plant blasts | publisher = People's Daily Online | date = 2005-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The blasts were so powerful that they shattered windows at least 100 to 200 meters away; at least 70 people were injured and six were killed.&lt;ref name="chemicalplantexplosion"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsfromrussia.com/world/2005/11/14/67613.html |title=Chemical plant explosion in China: one confirmed dead |last= |first= |date=14 November 2005 |work=Pravda |access-date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210073947/http://newsfromrussia.com/world/2005/11/14/67613.html |archive-date=10 February 2006 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Conflagration|fires]] were finally put out early in the morning of November 14. Over 10,000 people were evacuated from the area, including local residents and students at the north campus of [[Beihua University]] and [[Jilin Institute of Chemical Technology]],&lt;ref name="evacuationjilin"&gt;{{cite news| title= 6 missing, 70 wounded in chemical plant blasts | publisher =Xinhua | url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-11/13/content_3775869.htm | date = 13 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; for fear of further explosions and [[contamination]] with harmful [[chemical]]s. [[China National Petroleum Corporation|The CNPC]], which owns the company in charge of the factory, [[Jilin Petrochemical Corporation]], has asked senior officials to investigate the cause of the incidents.&lt;ref name="investigationjilin"&gt;{{cite news | title= China's CNPC investigating cause of blasts at Jilin chemical unit | url = https://www.forbes.com/business/feeds/afx/2005/11/13/afx2333504.html | publisher = Forbes | date= 13 November 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519003136/http://www.forbes.com/business/feeds/afx/2005/11/13/afx2333504.html|archivedate=19 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The explosions are not thought to be related to terrorism, and the company told a press conference that they had occurred as a result of a chemical blockage that had gone unfixed.&lt;ref name=cctvcom&gt;{{cite news | url = http://english.cctv.com/program/bizchina/20051114/101305.shtml | title = Company admit fault in chemical blast | work = cctv.com | date = 2005-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The municipal government asked hotels and restaurants in the city to provide rooms for the evacuated people. [[taxicab|Taxi]] companies also aided in the evacuation.

== [[Water pollution]] ==
[[Image:LocationSonghua.PNG|thumb|The [[Songhua River]].]]
The explosion severely [[polluted]] the [[Songhua River]], with an estimated 100 tons of pollutants containing [[benzene]] and [[nitrobenzene]] entering into the river.&lt;ref name="100tons"&gt;{{cite news |title = China pledges to minimize impact of river pollution on Russia | url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-11/24/content_3831641.htm | publisher = Xinhua | date = 24 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to benzene reduces [[red blood cell]] count and is linked to [[leukemia]].

An 80&amp;nbsp;km long toxic slick drifted down the Amur River, and the benzene level recorded was at one point 108 times above national safety levels. The slick passed first on the [[Songhua River]] through several counties and cities of [[Jilin]] province, including [[Songyuan]]; it then entered the province of [[Heilongjiang]], with [[Harbin]], capital of [[Heilongjiang]] province and one of China's largest cities, being one of the first places to be affected. After traversing the eastern half of Heilongjiang including the city of [[Jiamusi]], the slick converged into the [[Amur River]] at the mouth of the [[Songhua]] on the border between China and [[Russia]]. It passed by the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]] in Russia, then entered the Russian region of [[Khabarovsk Krai]] in the [[Russian Far East]], passing through the cities of [[Khabarovsk]] and [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur]] before exiting into the [[Strait of Tartary]], itself a bridge between the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] and the [[Sea of Japan]] portions of the [[Pacific Ocean]].

===Jilin Province===
On November 13, a water plant in Jilin city, [[Jilin]], was closed. Several [[hydropower]] stations in the upper reach of [[Songhua River]] began to increase their discharge flow. On November 15, [[Songyuan]], Jilin, stopped using water from [[Songhua River]]. By November 18, water supplies in Songyuan, Jilin, were partially suspended. Water supplies in Songyuan, Jilin, were restored on November 23.

===Heilongjiang Province===
[[Harbin]], the capital of Heilongjiang, is one of China's biggest cities with nearly ten million urban residents. It is also dependent on the Songhua River for its water supply.

On November 21, the city government of Harbin announced that water supplies would be shut off at noon November 22 for four days for maintenance. Some residents of Harbin have complained that water in some parts of the city had been shut off much earlier than announced. The city also ordered all bathhouses and carwashes to close. At the same time as the enigmatic announcement, rumours ran wild about the possible cause of the shutoff, with some suggesting that an earthquake was imminent (causing some people to camp outdoors) and others claiming that terrorists had poisoned the city's water supply. The news of the shutoff caused [[panic buying]] of water, beverages, and foodstuffs in the city's supermarkets, while train tickets and flights out of the area were soon sold out. Meanwhile, dead fish were appearing along the banks of the Songhua upstream from Harbin, further compounding the fears of Harbin residents.

Later on the same day, the city government issued another announcement, this time explicitly mentioning the Jilin explosions as the reason for the shutoff. The four-day shutoff was postponed to midnight on November 24. From 9&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 8&amp;nbsp;p.m. on November 23, the city temporarily restored the water supply to allow residents to stock up on water, since the slick had not yet reached the city. In the afternoon of the same day, schools in Harbin were closed for one week. Also on November 23, Harbin residents began to receive water from fire trucks, and began voluntary evacuation.

The slick itself reached Harbin before dawn on November 24. On that day, the nitrobenzene level at Harbin was recorded at 16.87 times above the national safety level, while the benzene level was increasing, but had not yet exceeded national safety level. The nitrobenzene level doubled on November 25 (0.5805&amp;nbsp;mg/L), 33.15 times the national safety level, and began to decrease. The benzene level stayed under national safety level. At the same time, the tail of the slick left [[Zhaoyuan County|Zhaoyuan]], [[Daqing]], [[Heilongjiang]]. [[Premier]] [[Wen Jiabao]] of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] visited Harbin on November 26 to inspect the current situation, including the status of water pollution and water supply.

In response to the crisis, trucks transported tens of thousands of metric tons of water from surrounding cities, and thousands of tons of [[activated carbon]] from all over the country to Harbin. The government of Harbin also ordered the price of drinking water to be frozen at the level of November 20, in order to combat overpricing. In addition, Harbin is boring ninety-five more deep-water wells, to complement the existing 918 deep-water wells in the city. Fifteen hospitals were on stand-by for possible poisoning victims.

Harbin was not the only city to be affected. The slick passed through the city of [[Jiamusi]], which, however, relies more heavily on underground water supply, and thus did not cut off water supplies. Nevertheless, on December&amp;nbsp;2, Jiamusi shut down its No.&amp;nbsp;7 Water Plant, which supplies around 70% of the city's water supply, and evacuated half of the population on its Liushu island.

It is reported that the entry of several tributaries into the Songhua, such as the [[Hulan River]] and the [[Mudan River]], diluted the slick.

Water supply in Harbin was resumed in the evening of November 27.

=== Khabarovsk Krai ===
The slick reached the [[Amur River]] at December 16,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4534542.stm | title = Toxic leak reaches Russian river | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 2005-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and arrived at the Russian city of [[Khabarovsk]] four to five days later. In readiness, a communications hotline had been set up between Chinese and Russian agencies, and China offered water testing and purifying materials, including 1,000 tons of [[activated carbon]] to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-12/16/content_3932826.htm | title = 2nd batch of water purifying materials offered to Russia | work = www.chinaview.cn | date = 2005-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Khabarovsk planned to shut off its water supply in "extreme circumstances", prompting residents to stock up on water.

== Maritime pollution ==
After exiting the Amur River, the [[contaminants]] entered the [[Strait of Tartary]] and then the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] and the [[Sea of Japan]], which have [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and Far-East Russia on its [[littoral]]s.

== Political fall-out ==
[[Xie Zhenhua (politician)|Xie Zhenhua]], China's Minister of State Environmental Protection Administration, resigned and was succeeded by [[Zhou Shengxian]], former director of the State Forestry Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-12/02/content_3870384.htm | title = Environmental chief sacked following major pollution | work = www.chinaview.cn | date = 2005-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The Chinese press were critical of the authorities' response to the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4465712.stm | title = Chinese papers condemn Harbin 'lies' | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 2005-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jilin Petrochemical Corporation|Jilin Petrochemicals]], which runs the plant that suffered the explosions, initially denied that the explosion could have leaked any pollutants into the Songhua River, saying that it produced only water and [[carbon dioxide]]. The media has focused mostly on Harbin, with almost no information on the slick's effect on cities and counties in Jilin province. Heilongjiang responded to the crisis a full week after the explosions occurred—their initial announcement attributed the impending shutoff to "maintenance", and gave only a day's notice; it was the second announcement on the next day that clarified the reason for the shutoff and postponed the shutoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4463580.stm | title = Pollution worries China's press | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 2005-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Vice Governor [[Jiao Zhengzhong]] of [[Jilin]] province and Deputy General Manager [[Zeng Yukang]] of [[China National Petroleum Corporation|CNPC]] have visited Harbin and expressed their apologies to the city.  On 6 December, the vice-mayor of Jilin, Wang Wei, was found dead in his home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4505650.stm | title = Chinese toxic blast official dead | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 7 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed a threat by the Chinese government to severely punish anyone who had covered up the severity of the accident. The threat applied only to the initial explosion and not the extended cover up of the benzene slick.

The '''2011 Bohai bay oil spill''' ({{zh|s=2011年渤海湾油田溢油事故}}) was a series of oil spills that began on June 4, 2011 at [[Bohai Bay]].  The spill itself however was not publicly disclosed until a month later.&lt;ref name="peopled1"&gt;{{cite web|author =F_129 |url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90780/7433972.html |title=China needs zero tolerance for concealing major accidents - People's Daily Online |publisher=English.peopledaily.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were suspicions of official cover-ups by the [[State Oceanic Administration]] (SOA).&lt;ref name="g1"&gt;{{cite web|author =AFP |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g1DtRQXcJM2RpEW_KOJIffKOFcMg?docId=CNG.3b125dfe28679f2d64709b29ae9b278f.991 |title=AFP: China oil spill six times size of Singapore: govt |publisher=Google.com |date=2011-07-13 |accessdate=2011-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
The oil field is 51% owned by [[China National Offshore Oil Corporation]], and 49% owned by the [[United States]] company [[ConocoPhillips]].&lt;ref name="sinaoil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2011-07-07/055522770891.shtml |title=康菲公司正在制订赔偿方案_新闻中心_新浪网 |publisher=News.sina.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spills==

===1st oil spill===
On June 4, 2011 the Penglai 19-3 oilfield caused an oil spill from a sea floor leak that lasted until June 7.&lt;ref name="donga1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?biid=2011070764048 |title=donga.com[English donga&amp;#93; |publisher=English.donga.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2nd oil spill===
On June 17 a second oil spill that occurred at the Penglai 19-3 oilfield, but was contained within 48 hours.&lt;ref name="sinaoil"/&gt;  By the second leak, it was reported that a total of 840 square kilometers of first grade clean water in [[Bohai Bay]] was polluted.&lt;ref name="peopled1"/&gt;

===3rd oil spill===
A third leak took place on July 12 with the Suizhong 36-1 oil field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/another-oil-leak-off-china-s-coast-halts-drilling-operations |title=Another Oil Leak off China’s Coast Halts Drilling Operations |publisher=Maritime-executive.com |date=2011-07-13 |accessdate=2011-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This occurred just one day after the Huizhou refinery explosion incident.  In total the leaks contaminated a total of 4,250 square kilometers.  The media has described the spill to be six times the size of [[Singapore]].&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

==Leak disclosure==
The oil spill was not publicly reported until 31 days later on July 5, 2011.&lt;ref name="peopled1" /&gt;  It was only revealed because of a public microblog tip-off that appeared on June 21.&lt;ref name="gn1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/NEWS/tabid/99/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/664841/SOA-oil-spill-response-fails-to-inspire-confidence.aspx |title=SOA oil spill response fails to inspire confidence |publisher=Globaltimes.cn |date=2011-07-06 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The news of the oil spill was withheld by the [[State Oceanic Administration]] (SOA) for a month.  In a statement by the SOA, the US company ConocoPhillips managing the platform was held responsible for the leak, and was fined 200,000 yuan ([[US$]]31,000).&lt;ref name="sinaoil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gn1" /&gt;  CNOOC however, said they informed government authorities from the start.&lt;ref name="g2"&gt;{{cite web|author =AFP |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jPHTfOyRANJtDi9rme41mKJm6Caw?docId=CNG.e534a1c0032067700107b068a657830a.5c1 |title=AFP: China probes ConocoPhillips over oil spill |publisher=Google.com |date=2011-07-04 |accessdate=2011-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment impact==
Outside of the spill area, dead seaweed and rotting fish can be seen around Nanhuangcheng island (南隍城島) in [[Shandong province]].&lt;ref name="g2" /&gt;

"The oil, containing toxic substances and heavy metals, will greatly affect the growth of marine lives that live on the seabed, such as clams, scallops and some kinds of crabs," Xinhua reported last week quoting Cui Wenlin, director of the environmental monitoring centre with the North China Sea branch of the SOA.

Bohai is a half-closed sea with comparatively low self-clean ability due to limited water exchange with the outside, he added.

The environmental monitoring centre Cui directs has been monitoring the impacts of the oil spills on the Bohai's water quality, seabed sediments and marine lives.

Though the US firm claims that no oil sheen reached the shoreline after the spills, Xinhua reports that "dead seaweed and rotting fish have been reported in the water around Nanhuangcheng Island, about 74 kilometres south from where the leaks originated".

==Responses==
Further criticism followed that if the spilled oil were to flow into the [[Yellow Sea]], this will damage both [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name="donga1" /&gt;  Korean media have complained about Beijing being as irresponsible as the Japanese's reluctant to share information about [[2011 Japanese nuclear accidents|its nuclear disasters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2011/07/137_90742.html |title=Oil spill in China |publisher=Koreatimes.co.kr |date=2011-07-13 |accessdate=2011-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ConocoPhillips said the spill was the equivalent of 1,500 barrels of oil.&lt;ref name="g1" /&gt;

But many Chinese environmental organisations questioned the credibility of the spill volume released by ConocoPhillips.

Zhong Yu, senior action coordinator of [[Greenpeace]], an international environmental organisation, told Xinhua that “the amount is questionable” because, apart from ConocoPhillips and the SOA, ‘no third party attended the assessment’.

In addition, 11 environmental organisations sent an open letter to ConocoPhillips China and CNOOC Ltd on Thursday, asking the two companies to assist the organisations and other people concerned to visit the scene of the leak to investigate the incident and its aftermath.

==Track records==

The CNOOC has recently come under scrutiny for several accidents involving its facilities, the third such incident on the Bohai Sea in less than two months. Following an oil spill on Tuesday in its Suizhong 36-1 oilfield, it was to be shut temporarily, SOA announced in a statement. By Wednesday afternoon, CNOOC finished cleaning up an oil slick near the oilfield and gradually resumed production.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4393">The '''2012 Guangxi cadmium spill''' (广西镉污染事件&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paper.wenweipo.com/2012/02/03/CH1202030007.htm |title=有色金屬之鄉 污染危機未除 - 香港文匯報 |publisher=Paper.wenweipo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;) occurred in early January when toxic [[cadmium]] contaminated the [[Guangxi]] Longjiang river (龙江河) and water supply.

==Incident==
[[Hechi]] authorities estimated that more than 40,000 [[kilogram]]s of fish were found dead from January 15 to February 2 within the city limits.&lt;ref name="cdaily1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2012-02/04/content_14536059.htm |title=Officials fired over cadmium spill |publisher=chinadaily.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2012-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spill was caused by Jinhe Mining company (沿河兩岸工廠). The spill is estimated to be 80 times the official limit, according to regional government protection official Feng Zhennian&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-16804833|title=Seven detained over China river cadmium spill|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A toxic slick stretching more than 100[[kilometres|km]] along the Longjiang river reached the Nuomitan hydroelectric station, 57&amp;nbsp;km upstream from [[Liuzhou]], with cadmium levels five times above the national standard.&lt;ref&gt;South China morning post. No easy fix as huge spill threatens Liuzhou's water . 31 Jan 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  In one month 20 [[tonnes]] of toxic cadmium metals were spilled into the river.&lt;ref&gt;South China morning post. Toxic metal spill may be worst in decades. 1 Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control==

The '''Yellow River oil spill''' was an [[oil spill]] in the [[Yellow River]] in [[Shaanxi]], [[China]] which took place due to the rupturing of a segment of [[Lanzhou-Zhengzhou oil pipeline]] on December 30, 2009. Approximately {{convert|150000|l|usgal|abbr=on}} of [[diesel oil]] flowed down the [[Wei River]] before finally reaching the Yellow River, the source of drinking water for millions of people, on January 4, 2010.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8438362.stm|title=China water warning as oil spill hits Yellow River |date=4 January 2010| work=BBC News |accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;{{cite news | author=Jessie Jiang |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1951412,00.html?xid=rss-topstories|title=After Oil Spill, China's Polluted Rivers in Spotlight|date=4 January 2010| work=Time |accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Lanzhou-Zhengzhou oil pipeline project was approved in 2007 and opened for operation in March 2009. It is a part of the {{convert|2070|km|abbr=on}}-long [[Lanzhou-Zhengzhou-Changsha pipeline]] with a capacity of transporting 15 million tons of oil per year.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idINPEK17778220090331|title=China Lanzhou-Zhengzhou oil pipeline in operation|date=March 31, 2009| work=Reuters|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[China National Petroleum Corporation]] (CNPC), the rupture took place on December 30, 2009 due to an accident near [[Weinan]] where construction was underway by third-party workers.&lt;ref name="TIME" /&gt; However, the incident was not publicized until January 3, 2010.&lt;ref name="tg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jan/04/oil-spill-china-yellow-river|title=Chinese environment officials fail to stop oil slick from polluting Yellow river|last=Watts|first=Jonathan|date=4 January 2010| work=The Guardian|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deputy director of the [[Yellow River Water Resources Commission]] called for an investigation into the accident, refuting CNPC's claim that the accident was caused by third-party construction workers.&lt;ref name="Xinhua"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2010-01/05/content_12759672.htm|title=Spill spread may affect drinking water supply |date=5 January 2010| work=Xinhua News |accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spill control efforts==
About 150,000 litres of diesel had already leaked out before the pipeline was closed by CNPC. According to [[Pacific Environment]] China's co-director Wen Bo, 700 workers were quickly mobilized by the government to control the spill as soon as its occurrence became known.&lt;ref name="TIME" /&gt; They dug diversion channels and built floating dams to stop the pollutant from advancing further downstream.

The '''Tianji Coal Chemical Industry Group chemical spill''' was a severe chemical spill that occurred in [[Shanxi]] Province, [[China]] during 2012–13. More than 39 tons of [[aniline]]s (toxic chemicals widely used as precursors in the manufacture of pigment,&lt;ref&gt;Fei Xuening, Zhang Tianyong, Zhou Chunlong, Modification study involving a Naphthol as red pigment, Dyes and Pigments, Volume 44, Issue 2, January 2000, Pages 75-80, {{ISSN|0143-7208}}, {{doi|10.1016/S0143-7208(99)00072-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; herbicides &lt;ref&gt;Lyons, C. D., Katz, S. E., and Bartha, R.: Persistence and mutagenic potential of herbicide-derived aniline residues in pond water, B Environ Contam Tox, 35, 696-703, {{doi|10.1007/bf01636575}}, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; and other chemicals) leaked from a loose drainage valve at a plant owned by Tianji Coal Chemical Industry Group in the [[Shanxi]] city of [[Changzhi]]. This chemical spill contaminated the Zhuozhang River which is the source of drinking water for more than one million people, and so caused a water crisis in the downstream City of [[Handan]], [[Hebei]] Province.

== Tianji Coal Chemical Industry Group ==
Tianji Coal Chemical Industry Group is one of the five largest state-owned coal companies in Shanxi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://file.lw23.com/f/f8/f80/f80370ca-a8e5-43db-ae63-fd8b1d491ba7.pdf Current conditions and development of Tianji Group Company, in Chinese]&lt;/ref&gt; They use a water-intensive [[gasification]] process to convert [[coal]] to chemicals that are critical for a wide range of products. According to a Greenpeace report,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/china/zh/news/stories/toxics/2013/01/shanxi-coal-to-chemicals/ Greenpeace Report, Tianji pollution remains (in Chinese), Jan 2013 in Shanxi Province]&lt;/ref&gt; the factory owned by Tianji Industry Group in Changzhi dumps more than six million tons of wastewater per year. In 2010 and 2011, Tianji was judged by Shanxi’s environmental protection bureau to be polluting above normal levels in four quarters and was fined each time.

== Aniline leak ==
An aniline leak occurred on December 31, 2012 due to a poor-quality metal hose. About 39 tons of aniline, a potential [[carcinogen]], went into the drainage from the [[fertilizer]] factory. Thirty tons were contained by a reservoir, but nearly nine tons leaked into the Zhuozhang River. A large amount of dead fish was seen in the upper reaches of the Zhuozhang River. Leaked aniline traveled along the [[Zhang River]] and reached reservoirs in neighboring cities.

== Water crisis ==
The contaminated Zhuozhang River feeds into the [[Zhang River]], which is a source of drinking water for [[Shanxi]], [[Hebei]] and [[Henan]] provinces. Therefore, the spill affected at least 28 villages and a handful of cities of more than one million people, including Handan. After receiving confirmation of this chemical spill, officials in [[Handan]] shut down part of its municipal water supply system,&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenleapforward.com/2013/01/22/green-hops-aniline-spill-50-gw-renewables-target-nukes-resume/ China.org.cn Report, Aniline Spills, Jan 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; which sent residents into a scramble for bottled water. In the countryside, officials also told farmers not to graze their livestock near the river. Fire engines were mobilized to bring water to the city's residents and 66,000 bottles of clean water were bought in from other cities. Underground reservoirs were also opened to support the city’s water use.

== River cleanup ==
Nearly 5000 workers were called in for an immediate clean-up of the river.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/01/chinas-poison-filled-river/267195/ TheAtlantic Report, China's Poison-Filled River, Jan 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the low temperature, a large part of contaminants was stopped by ice in the river. 670 tons of contaminated ice and more than 750 tons of wastewater have been cleared away. [[Activated carbon]] was also used to absorb the chemicals remaining in the unfrozen water below.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2013-01/11/content_16104394.htm Chinadaily Report, Chemical leak into river puts focus on plant, Jan 11th 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; After several days of cleanup, concentrations of aniline in the river decreased to 2.15&amp;nbsp;mg/L from the previous level of 72&amp;nbsp;mg/L, according to data from Wangjiazhuang monitoring station on Zhuozhang river near the eastern border of Shanxi province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/china/2013-01/07/content_27607047.htm China org Report, Officials sacked over chemical leaks in N. China river, Jan 7th 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; However, based on national standards, the concentration should be less than 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/L. Since the pollutants are not expected to decompose easily, it took weeks to solve the problems caused by this spill.

== Delayed report ==
After the aniline leak occurred, officials in [[Changzhi]] delayed reporting the spill for five days. The reason for delay is not clear, but it may be due to the large underestimations of the amount of leaked anilines in the first few days after spills. According to the regulation passed by the State Council in 2007, an institution responsible for an accident should report within an hour to the production safety department of a county-level government or higher. The report should reach a higher level of government within two hours. The mayor of Changzhi has apologized for the delay in reporting the spill affecting supplies of drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2013/01/08/Chemical-spill-poisons-drinking-water/UPI-26131357623238/ UPI Report, Chemical spill poisons drinking water, Jan 8th 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Punishment ==
After investigation into this spill, 24 managers in the company who were responsible for supervision were given administrative disciplinary sanctions. The mayor of Changzhi was removed from his position. Two heads of the plant's storage workshop were fired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-02/20/c_132181262.htm Xinhua Net Report, 39 punished over N China chemical leak, Feb 20th 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==
The conflict over the Changzhi spill has drawn attention to the growing problems with water use and [[pollution in China]]. In 2011, inspections in 200 cities across China found that water in 55 percent of the tests was rated “fairly poor to extremely poor”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/world/asia/spill-in-china-lays-bare-environmental-concerns.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; New York Times Report, Spill in China Underlines Environmental Concerns, March 3rd 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; During the last ten years, China has witnessed major pollution incidents due to the pursuit of economic benefit and the neglect of pollution control by local governments and enterprises. Deficiencies in emergency mechanisms to handle environmental incidents at some local governments worsen the pollution problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/china/2013-01/07/content_27607047.htm China org Report, Officials sacked over chemical leaks in N. China river, Jan 7th 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Four Pests Campaign''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|除|四|害}}}}), was one of the first actions taken in the [[Great Leap Forward]] in China from 1958 to 1962. The four pests to be eliminated were [[rat]]s, [[fly|flies]], [[mosquito]]es, and [[sparrow]]s. The extermination of sparrows is also known as '''Great Sparrow Campaign''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|打|麻|雀|运|动}}|p={{linktext|Dǎ| Má|què| Yùn|dòng}}}}) or '''Kill Sparrows Campaign''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|消灭麻雀运动}}|p={{linktext|Xiāo|miè| Máquè| Yùndòng}}}}), which resulted in severe ecological imbalance, being one of the reasons of [[Great Chinese Famine]]. In 1960, Mao ended the campaign against sparrows and redirected the fourth focus to bed bugs.

==Campaign==
The "Four Pests" campaign was introduced in 1958 by [[Mao Zedong]], as a hygiene campaign aimed to eradicate the pests responsible for the transmission of pestilence and disease: the mosquitos responsible for malaria; the rodents that spread the plague; the pervasive airborne flies; and the sparrows – specifically the [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] – which ate [[grain]] seed and fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/bodyhorrors/2014/02/26/mao-four-pests-china-disease/#.WP7DeJMrJE4|title=Paved With Good Intentions: Mao Tse-Tung’s "Four Pests" Disaster – Body Horrors|date=2014-02-26|work=Body Horrors|access-date=2017-04-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also declared that "birds are public animals of capitalism".&lt;ref name=nowak/&gt; As a result of this campaign, many sparrows died from exhaustion; citizens would bang pots and pans so that sparrows would not have the chance to rest on tree branches and would fall dead from the sky.&lt;ref name=4P&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chineseposters.net/themes/four-pests.php|title=Eliminate the Four Pests (1958)|website=chineseposters.net|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sparrow nests were also destroyed, eggs were broken, and chicks were killed. In addition to these tactics, citizens also resorted to simply shooting the birds down from the sky.&lt;ref name=Dvorsky&gt;{{Cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822081443/http://io9.com/5927112/chinas-worst-self+inflicted-disaster-the-campaign-to-wipe-out-the-common-sparrow|title=China’s Worst Self-Inflicted Environmental Disaster: The Campaign to Wipe Out the Common Sparrow|last=Dvorsky|first=George|work=io9|access-date=2017-04-25|language=en-US|url=http://io9.com/5927112/chinas-worst-self+inflicted-disaster-the-campaign-to-wipe-out-the-common-sparrow|archivedate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mass attacks depleted the sparrow population, pushing it to near extinction.&lt;ref name=Dvorsky/&gt; Furthermore, contests were held among enterprises, government agencies, and schools in cleanliness.&lt;ref name=4P/&gt; Non-material rewards were given to those who handed in the largest number of rat tails, dead flies and mosquitoes, or dead sparrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chineseposters.net/themes/four-pests.php|title=Eliminate the Four Pests (1958)|website=chineseposters.net|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At dawn one day last week, the slaughter of the sparrows in Peking began, continuing a campaign that has been going on in the countryside for months. The objection to the sparrows is that, like the rest of China's inhabitants, they are hungry. They are accused of pecking away at supplies in warehouses and in paddyfields at an officially estimated rate of four pounds of grain per sparrow per year. And so divisions of soldiers deployed through Peking streets, their footfalls muffled by rubber-soled sneakers. Students and civil servants in high-collared tunics, and schoolchildren carrying pots and pans, ladles and spoons, quietly took up their stations. The total force, according to Radio Peking, numbered 3,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,863327,00.html|title=Red China: Death to Sparrows|date=1958-05-05|work=Time|access-date=2017-04-25|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some sparrows found [[refuge (ecology)|refuge]] in the [[extraterritoriality|extraterritorial]] premises of various [[diplomatic mission]]s in China. The personnel of the [[Embassy of Poland, Beijing|Polish embassy in Beijing]] denied the Chinese request of entering the premises of the embassy to scare away the sparrows who were hiding there and as a result the embassy was surrounded by people with drums. After two days of constant drumming, the Poles had to use shovels to clear the embassy of dead sparrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,75248,140878.html |title= Chiny.

==Revived campaign==
On June 19, 1998, a poster was spotted at [[Southwest Agricultural University]] in [[Chongqing]], "Get rid of the Four Pests". Ninety-five percent of households were ordered to get rid of four pests. This time, sparrows were replaced with [[cockroach]]es.&lt;ref name="Shapiro" /&gt; A similar campaign was spotted in the spring of 1998 in [[Beijing]]. Few people responded to these campaigns, as many already had the habit of killing the aforementioned pests, especially cockroaches.&lt;ref name="Shapiro" /&gt;

==Cultural influence==
In the [[TVB]] drama series ''[[Rosy Business]]'' (aired 2009 but set in mid-19th century China), a peasant came up with the idea of killing the sparrows to improve agricultural output. It was meant to be a prank used to trick the peasant owners into starvation and poverty.

In Episode 20 of the children's animated television series ''[[Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat]]'' (aired 2001–2002 but set in China around 1900), the mistress of the house declares that certain useless animals are banned from the compound. After the animals – the episode's eponymous birds, bees, and silkworms – are driven out, the family discovers the consequences. The mistress' fancy banquet is ruined by the lack of food and clothing, and she learns a valuable lesson.

The album ''[[Every Red Heart Shines Toward the Red Sun]]'' (2006) by the American post-rock band [[Red Sparowes]] tells, by way of its song titles, the story of the Great Sparrow Campaign.

The children's book ''[[Sparrow Girl]]'' (2009) by [[Sara Pennypacker]] tells the story of the Sparrow War.

The '''2013 Eastern China smog''' was a severe air pollution episode that affected [[East China]], including all or parts of the municipalities of [[Shanghai]] and [[Tianjin]], and the provinces of [[Hebei]], [[Shandong]], [[Jiangsu]], [[Anhui]], [[Henan]], and [[Zhejiang]], during December 2013. A lack of cold air flow, combined with slow-moving [[air mass]]es carrying industrial emissions, collected [[air pollution|airborne pollutants]] to form a thick layer of smog over the region. Levels of [[particulates|PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;]] particulate matter averaged over 150 micrograms per cubic metre; in some areas, they were 300 to 500 micrograms per cubic metre.

It was one of the worst bouts of air pollution in the area, cutting visibility and causing major disruption in transportation and daily activities. Airports, highways, and schools were closed.&lt;!--something about area-wide effects--&gt;

==Background==
In January 2013, China experienced massive fog and haze outbreak affecting about 600 million people and covering seventeen provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, a fourth of China's territory.&lt;ref name=nfzm201310&gt;{{cite news|title=China Will Establish Network To Monitor Smog's Health Effects (我国将建立雾霾健康影响监测网络) |url=http://www.infzm.com/content/95493 |work=[[Southern Weekly]] |language=Chinese |date=29 October 2013 |accessdate=7 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213073054/http://www.infzm.com/content/95493 |archivedate=13 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 September 2013, the State Council announced the "Air Pollution Prevention Plan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=(Authorized Release) Air Pollution Prevention Plan ((授权发布)大气污染防治行动计划) |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2013-09/12/c_117349304.htm |agency=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |language=Chinese |date=12 September 2013|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; China limited the fine particulate matter level, and the Chinese government officials' assessment index included improving the environment for the first time.&lt;ref name=nfzm201309&gt;{{cite news|title=Strictest in History: "Air Pollution Prevention Plan" Introduced (史上最严：《大气污染防治行动计划》出台) |url=http://www.infzm.com/content/94377 |work=[[Southern Weekly]] |language=Chinese |date=13 September 2013 |accessdate=7 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213070810/http://www.infzm.com/content/94377 |archivedate=13 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 November 2013, the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] and the [[China Meteorological Administration]] jointly released the "Green Paper on Climate Change: Addressing Climate Change (2013)". It stated that the fog and smog in China had increased in the past 50 years with the number of fog-free days significantly reduced, while that of the smog days were significantly increasing with the phenomenon of persisting smog days. The fastest growing fog and smog days occurred in the [[Pearl River Delta|Pearl]] and [[Yangtze River Delta Economic Zone|Yangtze River Delta]] regions, which are the most industrialized areas. The report also indicated that the main reason of increased fog and smog days is the yearly increase in [[fossil fuel]] consumption in China. The report calls for urgent implementation of regional joint prevention and control measures to effectively solve the air pollution crisis.&lt;ref name=nfzm201311&gt;{{cite news|title=Green Paper on Climate Change States Causes and Effects of Smog Days (气候变化绿皮书指出雾霾天原因及危害) |url=http://www.infzm.com/content/95690 |work=[[Southern Weekly]] |language=Chinese |date=5 November 2013 |accessdate=7 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213072253/http://www.infzm.com/content/95690 |archivedate=13 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weather===
The mixture of natural fog and unnatural smog started accumulating over the first weekend of December 2013. In Shanghai, the [[Air Quality Index]] (AQI) crossed the threshold of 300 on 2 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zhang |first=Yiqian |url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/829983.shtml |title=Severe winter smog shrouds eastern China |work=Global Times |date=5 December 2013|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lingering smog also left the air qualities in neighboring cities, such as [[Nanjing]], [[Jiaxing]], at seriously polluted levels. [[National Meteorological Center of CMA|The National Meteorological Center]] (NMC) issued yellow alert for smog and fog, the third most serious alert in China's four-tiered system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Smog and fog hit east, north China|url=http://www.china.org.cn/environment/2013-12/06/content_30814209.htm|accessdate=29 March 2014|agency=Xinhua News Agency|date=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; particulate levels reached their highest point on 6 December 2013, with Shanghai reaching a high of 507.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CGShanghaiAir/status/408811882850426880 |title=12-06-2013 12:00; PM2.5; 507.0; 504; Beyond Index (at 24-hour exposure at this level) |publisher=Con Gen ShanghaiAir |date=6 December 2013|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Embassy categorizes air quality readings over 300 as hazardous to all humans, not just those with heart or lung ailments.

According to a NASA Terra Satellite image, the thick haze stretches over Eastern China, across a distance of around {{convert|1200|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=82535 |title=Smog Shrouds Eastern China |publisher=Earth Observatory |date=10 December 2013|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The polluted air appears gray on the image and most of the pollution is trapped in the lower boundary layer of a few hundred meters.

===Causes===
Coal burning is a primary source of fine particle air pollution. It increased as the weather worsened during winter months and residents burned more coal to keep warm. This increased the amount of [[sulphate]] and [[nitrate]] (results of coal combusting), which led to higher PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;. Research suggests that 41% of the [[carbon]] that made up these high PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; levels in Shanghai were also from coal burning.&lt;ref&gt;Cao, J.-J., Zhu, C.-S., Tie, X.-X., Geng, F.-H., Xu, H.-M., Ho, S.S.H., Wang, G.H., Han, Y.-M., Ho, K.-F. (2013). Characteristics and sources of carbonaceous aerosols from Shanghai, China. Atmos. Chem. Phys., 13, 803–817, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there were pollution from industrial sources. [[Jiangsu]], Anhui, [[Shandong]], Henan and many eastern provinces are heavy coal-burning regions. Research shows that prevailing winds blew low-hanging air masses of factory emissions (mostly [[sulfur dioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) towards the east coast of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/newsdesk/energy/data/map-shanghais-charts-air-pollution |title=Map: Shanghai's off the charts air pollution |publisher=Greenpeace |date=6 December 2013 |accessdate=24 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307155938/http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/newsdesk/energy/data/map-shanghais-charts-air-pollution |archive-date=7 March 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regional transportation also had a significant impact on air quality.

The State Environmental Protection Administration investigates tens of thousands of polluters every year, shutting down thousands of the worse offenders, but has failed to reach its target of reducing emissions by 2 percent.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.360doc.com/content/07/0508/23/21275_489581.shtml China shuts down thousands of firms for pollution offences]". ''People Online''. 8 May 2007. Retrieved 22 Oct 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, a factory manufacturing solar panels in Zhejiang province had been shut down because of toxic emissions of [[fluorine]] polluting air and water, sickening nearby residents.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.360doc.com/content/11/0919/11/363711_149446231.shtml Solar panel plant shut down as residents protest]".

==Effects on major cities and provinces==

===Shanghai===
[[File:Shanghai haze in Huangpu Distract 20131206.jpg|thumb|Smog in Huangpu District, Shanghai, 6 December 2013]]
Air in Shanghai was reported to have strange taste – astringent and smoky, with an aftertaste of earthy bitterness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/07/shanghai-smog_n_4402477.html |title=Shanghai Smog Hits Extremely Hazardous Levels |work=Huffington Post |date=7 December 2013|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was possible to feel the dust-like particulate matter on tongues.

With such a high concentration of air pollutants, government authorities warned residents of health symptoms, such as coughing and headaches. Citizens were advised to wear protective masks and use air purifiers. Many sanitation workers were required to wear dust masks during work early in the morning. Schools were closed as the government ordered children to stay indoors, and reduce outdoor activities as much as possible.

Construction work was halted and authorities pulled nearly one-third of government vehicles from the roads. A majority of inbound flights were cancelled and more than 50 flights were diverted at Shanghai Pudong International Airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1374386/children-and-elderly-told-stay-home-severe-smog-continues-envelop?_ga=1.70899472.1277584320.1394050026 |title=Shanghai grinds to a halt as smog nears top of air pollution scale |work=South China Morning Post |date=7 December 2013|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nanjing===
The heavy smog greatly polluted central and southern Jiangsu Province, especially around [[Nanjing]], capital of East China's Jiangsu province.&lt;ref name=wylww/&gt; AQI remained at "severely polluted" for five straight days, "heavily polluted" for nine, and hit a record-breaking value of 331.

[[File:Air Contamination in Ningbo, 2013-12-07 02.jpg|thumb|Air contamination in Ningbo, Zhejiang, 7 December 2013]]

==Environmental impacts==
The severe smog is raising awareness in re-assessing China's air pollution. On 12 February 2014, China's cabinet announced that government will implement a series of measures aimed at shifting the primary energy source from coal to natural gas and [[renewable energy|renewables]]. Pricing mechanisms will be used to favor cleaner alternatives to coal. Financial incentives will be offered to encourage [[sustainable energy|green energy]] companies. The government will place tougher controls over emissions and better support for developing clean technologies. It will also set up a 10 billion renminbi (US$1.7 billion) fund to help companies to meet new environmental standards.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu, Jane. ''Fight against smog ramps up'' ([http://www.nature.com/news/fight-against-smog-ramps-up-1.14730 Nature], 18 February 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pollutants ==
[[File:上海中心 20131206 114511.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Heavy smog obscures the top of [[Shanghai Tower]]]]
PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;, a particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less, is one of the major components of the air pollution in Eastern China, contributing to the growing smog problem in large areas across cities.&lt;ref name="science 1"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The socioeconomic drivers of China's primary PM2.5 emissions | journal=Environmental Research Letters | volume=9 | issue=2 | pages=024010 | doi=10.1088/1748-9326/9/2/024010 |year = 2014|last1 = Guan|first1 = Dabo| last2=Su | first2=Xin | last3=Zhang | first3=Qiang | last4=Peters | first4=Glen P. | last5=Liu | first5=Zhu | last6=Lei | first6=Yu | last7=He | first7=Kebin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; particles varies, and they are often made of heavy metals and various toxic compounds, such as lead and sulfate. Small particles can be suspended in the air for long periods of time due to their low masses. While some particles such as large-size carbon may be seen as soot and smoke, most of them can only be detected with a [[microscope]]. The Chinese Academy of Sciences indicated that smog in Beijing is a combination of both artificial factors and natural factors. While various causes such as [[coal]] burning and car emissions come from human activity, natural causes such as the humid weather and a lack of [[wind]] also contributed to the smog.&lt;ref name="science 2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.china.org.cn/video/2013-02/19/content_27995340.htm | title=Toxic compound found in Beijing smog | publisher=China.org.cn | accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in 2005 in Beijing showed that PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; is mostly composed of carbon, SO{{su|b=4|p=2−}} salts, NO{{su|b=3|p=−}} salts, and NH{{su|b=4|p=+}} salts. PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; is a byproduct of the process of coal burning from power stations and produces significant amounts of sulfate, black carbon, ammonium, and nitrate. In 1989, 32.7% of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; particulates in Beijing came from burning of coal, which decreased to 16.4% in 2000, as people started to use cleaner energy such as [[natural gas]]. Automobile exhaust also significantly contributed to the smog problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282414458 | title=Chemical characteristics of PM2.5 species in Beijing ambient air | publisher=Beijing GM Research and Development Center | accessdate=6 May 2016 | author=Chan Chak | pages=48090–9055}}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, such chemicals, along with [[organic carbon]] released from coal burning, may react with each other in the air, creating more toxic, harmful particles made of SO{{su|b=4|p=2−}} and NO{{su|b=3|p=−}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/13/4631/2013/acp-13-4631-2013.pdf | title=Characteristics of concentrations and chemical compositions for PM2.5 in the region of Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei, China | publisher=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics | accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; particles are small enough to pass through the human [[respiratory system]] and reach the [[lung]], causing problems like [[heart attacks]] and [[asthma]] attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www3.epa.gov/pmdesignations/basicinfo.htm | title=Fine Particle (PM2.5) Designations | publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency | accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In northern China, people live, on average, 5.5 years fewer than those in southern China, because of the over-reliance on burning coal for heating systems, which produces huge amounts of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; pollutants in winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/09/news/china-air-pollution/ | title=Air pollution cuts life expectancy by 5.5 years in China - study | publisher=CNN | accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollution from China has already affected other countries, and some ozone-forming particles have travelled across the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the [[United States]], contributing to a relatively high level of ozone on the American West Coast. While these particles, along with other ozone-related chemicals, can be carried up to 30,000 feet above the ground, researchers in the United States predict that these pollutants may play a bigger role in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/13/chinese-pollution-is-coming-to-america.html | title=Chinese pollution is coming to America | publisher=CNBC | accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bacteria in PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; ===
Scientists are still trying to understand the microorganisms within PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; particles and how they are spread through pollutants. Research indicated that many kinds of pathogens and bacteria can be spread through PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; smog and cause diseases. For example, Chinese researchers have found that smog in Beijing contains significant amounts of inhalable microbial allergens and pathogenic species, which increase the risk of respiratory diseases.&lt;ref name = micro&gt;{{cite journal | title=Inhalable Microorganisms in Beijing's PM2.5 and PM10 Pollutants during a Severe Smog Event | journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume=48 | issue=3 | pages=1499–1507 | doi=10.1021/es4048472 |year = 2014|last1 = Cao|first1 = Chen| last2=Jiang | first2=Wenjun | last3=Wang | first3=Buying | last4=Fang | first4=Jianhuo | last5=Lang | first5=Jidong | last6=Tian | first6=Geng | last7=Jiang | first7=Jingkun | last8=Zhu | first8=Ting F. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study also reported that among all the microorganisms within PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; particles, 86.1% are [[bacteria]], 13% [[eukaryota]], 0.8% [[archaea]], and 0.1% viruses.&lt;ref name = "micro" /&gt; The smog contains a variety of microorganisms such as ''[[Actinobacteria]], [[Proteobacteria]], [[Chloroflexi (phylum)|Chloroflexi]], [[Firmicutes]], [[Bacteroidetes]],'' and ''[[Euryarchaeota]].'' Many of these are not harmful to humans, but some pathogenic microorganisms are carried through smog, and their numbers increase as the pollutant level increases.&lt;ref name = "micro" /&gt;

More than 1,300 kinds of microorganisms have been detected on PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; particles. Because PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; particles have relatively large surface area, many microorganisms from the soil easily attach to them, spreading them quickly through wind. For example, scientists detected that ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]'' var. ''fumigatus'', a fungus which triggers allergic reactions in the respiratory system, are 1% to 8% of microorganisms found on PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2014-02-24/192129551860.shtml | title=清华大学在北京雾霾中检测出1300种微生物 | publisher=新闻中心 | accessdate=13 May 2016 |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Index ===
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has developed an Air Quality Index that is used to report air quality. This AQI is divided into six categories indicating increasing levels of health concern. A PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; concentration lower than 12&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; indicates good air quality and between 12 and 35&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; the airquality is moderate. An AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality and below 50 the air quality is good.&lt;ref name="aqi_basic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=aqibasics.aqi | title = Air Quality Index (AQI) - A Guide to Air Quality and Your Health|date= 9 December 2011 | accessdate = 8 August 2012| publisher = US EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, huge areas of Eastern China reached "hazardous" level for multiple days.

A dense wave of [[smog]] began in Northeast China, especially in major cities including [[Harbin]], [[Changchun]] and [[Shenyang]], as well as the surrounding [[Heilongjiang]], [[Jilin]], and [[Liaoning]] [[Provinces of China|provinces]] on 20 October 2013. Unseasonably warm temperatures{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} with very little wind across northeastern China coincided with the initiation of Northeast China's coal-powered municipal heating system. Record densities of fine [[particulates]] were measured in the city.

In Harbin, the levels of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; particulate matter rose to 1,000 micrograms per cubic metre, worse than Beijing's historic highs. Visibility dropped to {{convert|50|m|ft}} and authorities grounded flights and closed more than 2,000 schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/24/dutch-artist-roosegaarde-vacuum-cleaner-china-smog  Suck it and see: Dutch artist's vacuum cleaner could clear China smog] The Guardian 24.10.2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In Changchun, air pollution recorded at an all-time high and the levels of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; particulate matter rose to 845 micrograms per cubic metre on 22 October 2013.&lt;ref name=ccrecord&gt;{{cite news|title=长春雾霾天气强度破63年历史纪录|url=http://www.chinanews.com/gn/2013/10-23/5416856.shtml|accessdate=21 July 2014|agency=中国新闻网|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The smog eased on 25 October 2013 and had completely dissipated by the 28th due to a cold front that had moved in from [[Russia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5062">The '''2009 Chinese lead poisoning scandal''' occurred in the [[Shaanxi]] province of [[China]] when pollution from a [[lead]] plant [[lead poisoning|poisoned]] children in the surrounding area.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6832217.ece ''China uses fear to hush up poisoned children'']&lt;/ref&gt; Over 850 were affected. Villagers have accused the local and central governments of covering up the scandal.

==History==
In 2003 the Dongling Lead and Zinc Smelting Company set up a factory in the Changqing [[Township (People's Republic of China)|township]]&lt;ref name=Tel&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/6061009/More-than-1300-children-fall-ill-near-Chinese-smelting-plants.html ''More than 1,300 children fall ill near Chinese smelting plants'']&lt;/ref&gt; near the city of [[Baoji]], describing it in brochures as "a garden-like factory".&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; Soon "100,000 [[ton]]s of lead and [[zinc]] a year and 700,000 tons of [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]" were being produced. In 2008 it paid more than [[£]]10m in taxes to the local government,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; 17% of the administration's total income, and provided jobs for 2,000 households.&lt;ref name=Tel/&gt; Local parents however noticed that children were showing signs of illness - such as nose bleeds and memory problems.&lt;ref name=Tel/&gt; 851 children from seven villages surrounding the plant displayed up to 10 times the level of lead in their blood deemed safe by Chinese authorities.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; Over 170 of the children had to be hospitalised.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reu&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSPEK183380 ''More parents protest against lead poisoning in China'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Local villagers protested to authorities but claim they were ignored. On 17 August 2009 they attacked the plant causing the managers to flee. The plant has now been closed down, but according to Western reports all coverage in the Chinese media of events has now been banned.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

The '''2007 Shandong coal mine flood''' was an incident that occurred on August 17, 2007 in [[Xintai]], [[Shandong]], [[People's Republic of China]], when heavy rain caused a river to burst a [[levee]] creating a flood into two mine shafts.  By 8:50 am (1:50GMT), the mine was inundated underwater.&lt;ref name="ea"&gt;English Aljazeera. "[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2007/08/2008525135547815568.html English Aljazeera]." ''Chinese miners trapped by floods.'' Retrieved on 2008-09-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Damages and casualties==
More than 200mm of rain had fallen in Xintai, causing a 50-metre breach of a levee of the [[Wen river]].  Water poured into the 860-metre deep pit at the Huayuan mine, quickly overwhelming the mine's pumps.&lt;ref name="ea" /&gt;  The 172 miners were trapped in a 3,000-foot-deep mine shaft when a mine operated by the Huayuan Mining Co.&lt;ref name="LA1"&gt;LA times. "[http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/19/world/fg-chinamine19 LA times]." ''Hope dim for Chinese miners.'' Retrieved on 2008-09-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nine others were also missing, in a nearby mine run by a different company. None of the 181 miners, living or dead, were recovered from the two mines after the accident.&lt;ref&gt;Chinadaily.com.cn. "[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-09/03/content_6077282.htm Chinadaily.com.cn]." ''Work safety situation still dime.'' Retrieved on 2008-09-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Huayuan mine was flooded with an estimated 12 million cubic metres of water. If all six available pumps were used around the clock they could pump out about 120,000 cubic metres of water a day. But only four were operational. Unofficially, experts say that it would take almost 100 days to drain the water inside the mine.&lt;ref name="Asianews1"&gt;Asianews.it. "[http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;art=10110&amp;size=A Asianews.it]." ''Beijing admits Xintai mining accidents were completely avoidable.'' Retrieved on 2008-09-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
An official at China.com.cn discussed the fact that signs of flooding had appeared in advance prior to the incident, and that the "disaster was completely avoidable."&lt;ref name="Asianews1" /&gt;  On September 6, the Shangdong provincial government issued a statement citing scientists who said that none of the miners would be able to make it out alive after that amount of time underground.&lt;ref&gt;Xinhuanet.com. "[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-09/06/content_6676117.htm Xinhuanet.com]." ''Beijing admits Xintai mining accidents were completely avoidable.'' Retrieved on 2008-09-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Xingang Port oil spill''' is a spill that occurred in July 2010 caused by a rupture and subsequent explosion of two [[Petroleum#Crude oil|crude oil]] [[pipeline transport|pipeline]]s that run to an oil storage depot of the [[China National Petroleum Corporation]] in [[Xingang Harbour]], [[Dalian]], [[Liaoning Province]], [[China]]. The 1,500 tonnes of oil spilled from the pipes created an {{convert|180|km2|abbr=on}} slick in the Yellow Sea that grew to {{convert|430|km2|abbr=on}} within a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Agence France-Presse |title=China rushes to clean up oil spill |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100719/wl_asia_afp/chinaenvironmentoilpollution |work=Yahoo!

==Incident==
{{Location map |China Liaoning |lat=38.92 |long=121.63 |type = landmark |width=250 |float=left |caption=''Location in Liaoning''}}

The spill occurred after a process to [[Hydrodesulfurization|desulfurize]] oil in a pipeline at the port began, triggering a fire which subsequently burned for 15 hours.  The fire burned from oil that was released from a filled storage tank with a 90,000 ton capacity that collapsed as a result of the fire. Oil from other nearby tanks was, according to a [[Greenpeace]] report released several weeks after the incident, intentionally released to prevent the fire from expanding towards a tank containing [[dimethylbenzene]], a flammable chemical.&lt;ref name="LAT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="greenpeace"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dalian Oil Spill: Preliminary Findings and Recommendations |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/china/en/press/release/dalian-oil-recommendations-steiner |publisher=Greenpeace |accessdate=10 August 2010 |date=2 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805232029/http://www.greenpeace.org/china/en/press/release/dalian-oil-recommendations-steiner |archivedate=August 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Containment and cover-up ==
Although Chinese government officials reported that as little as 1,500 tonnes of oil spilled,&lt;ref name="LAT" /&gt; a former University of Alaska marine conservation specialist, Rick Steiner, estimates the spill to have a much higher total, with somewhere in the range of 60,000 to 90,000 tons (18.47 to 27.70 million gallons) of oil spilled into the [[Yellow Sea]]. He said that "[i]t's enormous. That's at least as large as the official estimate of the Exxon Valdez disaster."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press |title=US expert: China oil spill far bigger than stated |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100730/ap_on_bi_ge/as_china_pipeline_explosion |work=Yahoo!

According to leaks on Weibo, the accident may have begun as early as June, 10. However, because the government never formally acknowledged the accident took place, as well as threatened informed citizens to delete their posts, the true nature of the accident was not clear to the public. No assessment on the effect on wildlife was ever carried out.

The ensuing fire burned for 15 hours and one firefighter drowned after being swept overboard into the water. There was extensive damage to local wildlife areas, aquaculture, and beaches were closed following the spill and conflagration which appeared to have been caused by the injection of a highly oxidizing sulfur reducing agent into a pipeline.&lt;ref name="LAT" /&gt;

On 26 July 2010, the Chinese local government announced the spill had been contained and that the spill had failed to reach open waters.&lt;ref name="Xinhua" /&gt; Cleanup efforts continued two weeks after the original explosion began, with operations to remove the oil performed at night when the oil is most viscous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hogg | first = Chris | title = China struggles to recover from 'worst ever' oil spill | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-10819987 | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 30 July 2010 | accessdate = 31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cleanup effort largely used low-tech methods, including containment booms and straw mats to absorb the oil, as well as a fleet of fishermen manually scooping oil out of the water and transferring it to barrels for storage and eventual disposal. Additionally, limited amounts of chemical dispersants were used, as well as a material to increase biodegradation of oil.&lt;ref name="greenpeace"/&gt;

== Reaction ==
After the incident the Chinese government announced that safety standards would be tightened up at ports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-07/23/c_13411979.htm|title=China orders ports to enhance safety after Dalian pipeline accident|publisher=[[Xinhua]]|date=23 July 2010|accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The oil spill affected several aspects of the area's economy. [[Tourism]] was affected after oil began washing ashore on beaches, some of which were closed after the spill; according to Greenpeace, additional oil washing ashore was a possibility that remained for the rest of the summer.&lt;ref name="greenpeace"/&gt;  The oil  severely affected fishing industry near Dalian, especially offshore [[shellfish]] farms, many of which were contaminated by the oil, either killing the fish or rendering them unfit for consumption. The economic loss was estimated to be as high as tens of million [[US dollar]]s.&lt;ref name="greenpeace"/&gt;  Environmental damage was also serious as a result of the spill; the majority of wildlife inhabiting the area was exposed to oil, which led to the deaths of some, while others were expected to display longer-term effects.&lt;ref name="greenpeace"/&gt;

[[Lu Guang (photographer)|Lu Guang's]] pictures of the oil spill and the subsequent funeral of firefighter Zhang Liang were awarded a third prize in the category "Spot News" in the 2011 World Press Photo contest.&lt;ref&gt;Jess Miller: "[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/dalian-oil-spill-photographer-receives-award-/blog/34625/ Dalian oil spill photographer receives award at World Press Photo]," Greenpeace News, 8 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Press Photo: [http://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2011 2011 Photo Contest].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Press Photo: [http://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2011/spot-news/lu-guang Lu Guang - 2011 Photo Contest].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2740">A series of [[explosion]]s caused by an [[industrial accident]] occurred on August 26, 2008 in [[Yizhou District, Hechi|Yizhou city]] in [[Guangxi province]] in [[southwest China]].

The disaster occurred at a factory owned by Guangxi Guangwei Chemical Co. in the development zone of Yizhou city&lt;ref name="APReport"&gt;Associated Press, [http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-08-26-china-blast_N.htm 16 killed in chemical plant blasts in China] (August 26, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/world/asia/27iht-explode.3.15684819.html Death toll reaches 20 after explosion at chemical plant in China], ''New York Times'' (August 27, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the state-run [[Xinhua News Agency]], "the plant mainly produces [[polyvinyl acetate]] (PVA), which is used in adhesives, calcium carbide, and [[vinyl acetate monomer]] (VAM), which is used in paints, adhesives and coatings."&lt;ref name="Xinhua"&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-08/27/content_9724017.htm 20 confirmed dead in S China chemical plant blast], Xinhua News Agency (August 27, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first explosion occurred at about 6 a.m. on August 26 at an [[organic compound]] workshop inside the plant; the cause is unknown.&lt;ref name="Xinhua"/&gt; Other explosions continued until 1 p.m. [[Conflagration|Fire]] spread over an area of nearly 108,000 square feet (10,000m²). The explosions caused the leak of toxic substances, including [[ammonia]], [[formaldehyde]], [[acetylene]], [[sulfurated hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]].&lt;ref name="APReport"/&gt;

At least 20 people were killed and at least 60 were injured; six people remained missing following the explosions. Fearing further explosions and leaks, the government [[emergency evacuation|evacuated]] 11,500 residents.&lt;ref name="APReport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Xinhua quoted the provincial toxic substances emergency center director as saying that the explosions causes no serious air or water pollution. The director also said that dams had been erected to prevent discharge of pollutants into the nearby [[Long River (Guangxi)|Long River]] (Longjiang).&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

A [[landslide]] of construction waste occurred at [[Shenzhen]], on 20 December 2015. It destroyed and buried industrial buildings and worker living quarters in the nearby industrial park. The death toll was 73, with 4 people reported missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Li|first1=Xiang|title=Forty five sentenced for deadly Shenzhen landslide|url=http://english.cctv.com/2017/05/06/ARTIuSKhoWPU4niSJHBSWLyV170506.shtml|accessdate=8 May 2017|agency=CCTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an industrial accident due to human negligence rather than a [[natural disaster]].

It has been reported that waste material generated from construction work elsewhere had been piled up in a former quarry over the past couple of years.&lt;ref name="BBC_20Dec"&gt;{{cite news|title=China landslide: Many missing after buildings collapse in Shenzhen|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-35144579|accessdate=21 December 2015|work=BBC|date=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="times21"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buckley|first1=Chris|last2=Ramzy|first2=Austin|title=Shenzhen, Embodying China’s Growth, Falls Risk to It|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/22/world/asia/china-landslide-shenzhen.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjacent natural hill did not slide, according to a geological report issued by the [[Ministry of Land and Resources]] on 21 December 2015.&lt;ref name="times21" /&gt;

==Landslide==
On 20 December 2015 at 11:40 am a pile of construction waste, stored on a hillside, slid down in an avalanche of mud and debris, destroying 33 buildings and covering an area greater than {{convert|10|ha|spell=in}} in the Hengtaiyu Industrial Park ({{lang|zh-hans|恒泰裕工业园}}), which is, administratively, under [[Guangming New District]] of [[Shenzhen]].&lt;ref name=hkfp2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zeng|first1=Vivienne|title=Man-made disaster: 91 missing in Shenzhen following construction waste landslide|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2015/12/21/man-made-disaster-91-missing-in-shenzhen-following-construction-waste-landslide/|work=Hong Kong Free Press|date=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The landslide reportedly ruptured a nearby {{convert|400|m|ft|adj=on}} section of the [[West–East Gas Pipeline#West.E2.80.93East Gas Pipeline II|West–East Gas Pipeline]] and triggered an explosion which was heard about {{convert|4|km}} away.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|title=China landslide sparks gas explosion and leaves dozens missing|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/20/china-landslide-sparks-gas-explosion-and-leaves-dozens-missing|agency=The Guardian| date=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hkfp1&gt;{{cite news|title=China landslide leaves 27 missing, sparks gas explosion: Xinhua|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2015/12/20/landslide-at-industrial-park-in-china-leaves-41-missing/|work=Hong Kong Free Press|agency=AFP|date=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[PetroChina]] stated that this was untrue,&lt;ref name=times21/&gt; although [[Reuters]] subsequently reported that PetroChina announced its plan to lay a temporary gas pipeline to replace the damaged one.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite news|title= PetroChina to build temporary gas pipe in 10 days after blast| agency = Reuters| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-petrochina-gas-blast-idUSKBN0U419C20151221 |date=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Ministry of Land and Resources, the landslide occurred after a 20-storey-high mountain of dumped earth and construction waste collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1893780/shenzhen-landslide-first-dead-body-found-among-debris |title=Shenzhen landslide: 76 missing, only one body found so far, authorities say |work=South China Morning Post |author1=He Huifeng |author2=Zhuang Pinghui |author3=Mimi Lau |date=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergency response ==
Chinese authorities had over 2,906 rescue personnel, including about 800 from the defence forces, excavating dirt and rubble at the Hengtaiyu industrial park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reinforcements join Shenzhen landslide rescue|url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-12/21/c_134937921.htm|website = Xinhua|accessdate = 22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 1,500 emergency rescuers were involved in the search for people trapped under the mud; {{As of|2015|12|21|alt=as of 21 December}}, seven people had been rescued, and 76 people were still missing.&lt;ref name=BBC_21Dec&gt;{{cite news|title=China landslide: Rescuers search for 85 people still missing|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-35148909|accessdate=21 December 2015|work=BBC|date=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 900 people have been evacuated from the area.&lt;ref name=BBC_21Dec/&gt;

Evacuees were billeted at a nearby sports centre.&lt;ref name=times21/&gt;

== Responses ==
[[Communist Party of China|Communist party]] General Secretary [[Xi Jinping]] and Premier [[Li Keqiang]] called for all-out rescue efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shenzhen landslide disaster shows urbanisation must go hand in hand with good governance |url = http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1893781/shenzhen-landslide-disaster-shows-urbanisation-must-go-hand|website = South China Morning Post|accessdate = 22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Ma Xingrui]], the Communist Party Secretary of [[Shenzhen]], rushed back from Beijing to Shenzhen during The [[Central Economic Work Conference]] after hearing of this landslide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = China’s former top scientist-turned-city party boss rushes back to Shenzhen after landslide |url = http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/1893731/chinas-former-top-scientist-turned-city-party-boss-rushes-back|website = South China Morning Post|accessdate = 22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] extended his condolences to the families of the victims of the landslide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ban extends condolences to people, Government of China in wake of devastating landslide |url = https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=52890#.VnoPHJMrIwQ|website = United Nations News Centre|accessdate = 22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 December, Ma Xingrui, along with other city officials, issued a public apology to Shenzhen citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shenzhen Landslide Man-made Event, Not Natural Disaster |url = http://english.cri.cn/12394/2015/12/26/4061s910109.htm|website = China Radio International|accessdate = 26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 December, the official who approved the construction of the waste dump that triggered the landslide, identified as the former director of Shenzhen Guangming New District Urban Management Bureau Xu Yuan'an ({{lang|zh-hans|徐远安}}), jumped off a building in [[Nanshan District, Shenzhen|Nanshan District]] in an apparent suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/1895516/shenzhen-landslide-aftermath-official-who-rubber-stamped-waste|title=Shenzhen landslide aftermath: Official who rubber-stamped waste dump that triggered disaster takes his own life|date=28 December 2015|work=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mourning ==
On 26 December, rescuers and officials mourned those who died in the landslide. The ritual was held seven days after the landslide, in line with the Chinese tradition. The mourners scattered white flowers on the debris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rescue team mourn victims of Shenzhen landslide|url = http://www.china.org.cn/china/2015-12/26/content_37401152.htm|website = Xinhua|accessdate = 26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baogang Tailings Dam''', also known as the '''Baotou Tailings Dam''' or '''Weikuang Dam''', is a [[tailings dam]] in [[Inner Mongolia]], [[China]], on the outer ring of the city of [[Baotou]], about 20 kilometres from the city centre. The dam is filled with [[tailings]] and waste slurry from nearby [[rare earth mineral]] refinery plants. Accounts of the tailings dam appeared in western media outlets after a visit in 2015 by British writers Tim Maughan, Liam Young and Kate Davies from ''Unknown Fields'', a "nomadic design studio" from London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maughan|first1=Tim|title=The dystopian lake filled by the world´s tech lust|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150402-the-worst-place-on-earth|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ryan|first1=Rowena|title=Baotou is the world’s biggest supplier of rare earth minerals and it’s hell on Earth|url=https://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/asia/baotou-is-the-worlds-biggest-supplier-of-rare-earth-minerals-and-its-hell-on-earth/news-story/371376b9893492cfc77d23744ca12bc5|publisher=news.com.au|accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This account contrasts with the Chinese media's own reporting of the rare earth industry in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Meng|first1=Fanbin|title=Huge rare earth industrial park coming to Inner Mongolia|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2017-08/29/content_31257475.htm|publisher=China Daily|accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the dam began in 1955 and it was complete in 1963 but was not used until 1965. It is owned by [[Baotou Steel]]. The circular dam is {{Convert|11.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and has a {{Convert|85000000|m3|acre.ft|abbr=on}} capacity. The dam will eventually increase {{Convert|1045|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height and have a capacity of {{Convert|233800000|m3|acre.ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baotou Steel Group tailings line monitoring system |url=http://www.beijinghuace.com/modetail.aspx?PID=200&amp;classid=80 |publisher=Beijing China test-chi Technology Co., Ltd. |accessdate=8 January 2016 |language=Chinese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121022641/http://beijinghuace.com/modetail.aspx?PID=200&amp;classid=80 |archivedate=21 January 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Capilla|first1=Antonio Valero|last2=Delgado|first2=Alicia Valero|title=Thanatia: The Destiny of the Earth's Mineral Resources: A Thermodynamic Cradle-to-Cradle Assessment|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9814602493|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVUCCwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=baotou+tailings+dam+height+meters&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bayan Obo Mining District]], about 120 kilometres from Baotou city is the world's biggest supplier of rare earth minerals. They are used in the production of smartphones, tablets and other technology, like wind turbines. Production creates millions of tons of waste per year which has drawn much criticism of the dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Breslin|first1=Sean|title=Toxic Lake in Inner Mongolia Created By World's Addiction To High-Tech Gadgets|url=http://www.weather.com/science/environment/news/baotou-artificial-lake-toxic-sludge|website=Weather.com|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemicals in the dam have been linked to lower crop yields in surrounding farmlands and serious health problems among local villagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiggins|first1=Ryan David|title=The Political Economy of Rare Earth Elements: Rising Powers and Technological Change|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137364258|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=waGhCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT127&amp;lpg=PT127&amp;dq=baotou+tailings+dam+height+meters&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YuRTsRuDRF&amp;sig=fbNI6qUVt--0uFhXcZkQ4wA0Jnk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimg--G-5jKAhVE8mMKHfncAJkQ6AEIODAE#v=onepage&amp;q=baotou%20tailings%20dam%20height%20meters&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[landslide]] occurred at about 5:38 am local time on 24 June 2017 in [[Diexi, Mao County|Diexi Town]], [[Mao County]], [[Sichuan Province]] in south-western [[PR China|China]]. It destroyed 40 homes in Xinmo Village and killed 10 people, with a further 73 people missing, as of 27 June.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A second smaller landslide at around 8:15 pm impeded rescue efforts.

==Background==
The location of [[Mao County]] between the [[Tibetan Plateau]] and the [[Sichuan Basin]] is characterized by deep mountain canyons with exposed [[batholith]]. In 1933, the landslide site became especially unstable after the  7.3-magnitude [[1933 Diexi earthquake|Diexi earthquake]], whose [[epicenter]] was only a few kilometers away from Xinmo Village.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Major [[geological hazard]]s occur on almost a yearly basis.&lt;ref name="thepaper"&gt;{{cite news|title=专家：历史上两次地震深刻影响茂县山体，监测暂无法完全覆盖|url=http://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1717228|accessdate=25 June 2017|publisher=thepaper.cn|date=25 June 2017|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture]], also known as Aba, where Mao County is located, was one of the regions worst affected by the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]]. During the earthquake, 20,258 people in Aba and 3,933 in Mao County were confirmed killed, and 8,183 people in Mao County were injured.&lt;ref name="qq"&gt;[https://view.inews.qq.com/w/WXN20170624016774080?refer=nwx&amp;cur_pos=0&amp;newsGid=20170624_r6040048 In pictures: Landslide in Sichuan buries over 100 people].

QQ News.&lt;/ref&gt; A large factor in the fatality rate during both the 1933 and 2008 earthquakes was the landslides and the subsequent formation of [[landslide dam]] lakes.&lt;ref name="thepaper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wenchuan"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cheng|first1=Genwei|last2=Wang|first2=Xiaodan|last3=He|first3=Xiubin|last4=Fan|first4=Jihui|last5=Fan|first5=Jianrong|date=September 2008|title=Outburst risk of barrier lakes in Sichuan, China|url=https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11629-008-0208-7|journal=Journal of Mountain Science|volume=5|issue=3|pages=189-193|doi=10.1007/s11629-008-0208-7|access-date=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1933 earthquake, a catastrophic landslide lake [[outburst flood]] occurred on the [[Min River (Sichuan)|Minjiang River]], which has its headwaters in Aba Prefecture and runs through the region of the landslide.&lt;ref name="wenchuan" /&gt;

The majority of Mao County residents, almost 90%, are of the [[Qiang people|Qiang ethnicity]]. Large numbers of students had also returned home from university studies. The landslide site is located near the locally known Songpinggou scenic area, where many tourists were staying in guest houses when the landslide struck.&lt;ref name="qq" /&gt;

The landslide occurred in the early morning on 24 June 2017 at about 5:38 am local time (21:38 on 23 June [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). It was preceded by three weeks of frequent, but not intense rains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Forty homes were destroyed in Xinmo Village (新磨村), where more than 140 people from at least 62 families were initially feared buried. The landslide also blocked a {{Convert|1.2|km||adj=on|spell=}} stretch of the Songping Stream (松坪沟),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as well as a 1,600 m section of road.&lt;ref name="chinadaily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2017-06/24/content_29870665.htm|title=Over 100 buried in SW China landslide|publisher=Chinadaily|accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately {{convert|4.5|e6m3||abbr=unit}}&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; of rock was displaced from the mountain crest. However, while avalanching downslope, the rock mass fragmented heavily and incorporated a large amount of pre-existing debris. The landslide finally formed a deposit of more than {{convert|13|e6m3||abbr=unit}}.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The mass covered a distance of more than 2,600 m with a height relief of almost 1,200 m in less than 60 seconds. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was estimated that the landslide hit the village at approximately 250 km/h. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

A second smaller landslide around 8:15 pm on 24 June affected the rescue work. At least 1,959 rescue and medical workers were involved in the recovery effort.&lt;ref name="smh24"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/china-landslide-more-than-100-feared-buried-as-village-destroyed-20170624-gwxr43.html|title=China landslide: more than 100 feared buried as village destroyed|publisher=The Sunday Morning Herald|accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fears of new landslides from the adjacent areas temporarily halted the work, which was resumed after the installation of a monitoring system capable of providing a timely alarm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Subsequent engineering analyses confirmed the possibility of new landslides coming from the same ridge.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They could run on the 2017 landslide deposit but also toward still-inhabited buildings located just upstream, and could potentially block the flow of the Songping Stream again.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scaringi|first=Gianvito|last2=Fan|first2=Xuanmei|last3=Xu|first3=Qiang|last4=Liu|first4=Chun|last5=Ouyang|first5=Chaojun|last6=Domènech|first6=Guillem|last7=Yang|first7=Fan|last8=Dai|first8=Lanxin|date=2018-02-21|title=Some considerations on the use of numerical methods to simulate past landslides and possible new failures: the case of the recent Xinmo landslide (Sichuan, China)|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323309160_Some_considerations_on_the_use_of_numerical_methods_to_simulate_past_landslides_and_possible_new_failures_the_case_of_the_recent_Xinmo_landslide_Sichuan_China|journal=Landslides|doi=10.1007/s10346-018-0953-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The landslide is though to be a delayed effect of the rock weakening and cracking caused by the 1933 [[1933 Diexi earthquake|Diexi earthquake]], which accelerated the chemo-mechanical degradation of the rock.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On the contrary, no apparent correlation with the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]] was found.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After the event, several cracks were identified from satellite imagery and significant surface deformation was found to have preceded the landslide by several months.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xu|first=Qiang|last2=Fan|first2=Xuanmei|last3=Scaringi|first3=Gianvito|date=2018-01-26|title=Brief communication: Post-seismic landslides, the tough lesson of a catastrophe|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320466014_Brief_communication_Post-seismic_landslides_the_tough_lesson_of_a_catastrophe?_sg=2A9z8DhIvvMiIR_e28pw_p1WmavlF6dVDaXcYgvAXEnAGdDPyQvWT96GxetoAEP4wXxkv0FArBITyau8lIIMHwGmQDcDjiUEnGkl4N4Y.DWFHRAGOJGq6hqX75J132Xe-XRqdXlhFoWNV2rZUuH3lNSSNHaGRpU35Zbuo0fxbgYLmqTmpvVFnvagtwshFyA|journal=Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences|volume=18|pages=397–343|doi=10.5194/nhess-18-397-2018|bibcode=2018NHESS..18..397F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Intrieri|first=Emanuele|last2=Raspini|first2=Federico|last3=Fumagalli|first3=Alfio|last4=Lu|first4=Ping|last5=Sara|first5=I|last6=Conte|first6=Del|last7=Farina|first7=Paolo|last8=Allievi|first8=Jacopo|last9=Ferretti|first9=Alessandro|date=2017-11-09|title=The Maoxian landslide as seen from space: detecting precursors of failure with Sentinel-1 data|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320947521_The_Maoxian_landslide_as_seen_from_space_detecting_precursors_of_failure_with_Sentinel-1_data|journal=Landslides|doi=10.1007/s10346-017-0915-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these precursory signals went unnoticed as no systematic remote sensing of the area was being carried out, and the cracks were not visible from the town or from the valley.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A [[polyunsaturated]] [[aliphatic]] [[hydrocarbon]] mixture (called "Pyrolysed Carbon Nine" in petrochemical industry) leaked while Donggang Petrochemical Industry Co., Ltd. was loading oil at about 1 a.m. on November 4, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.163.com/18/1108/10/E0357GTJ00258169.html|title=福建东港石化碳九泄漏 官方：大气指标已恢复正常|accessdate=2018-11-08|last=网易|work=money.163.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
On November 4, 2018, Fujian Donggang Petrochemical Industry Co., Ltd. carried out oil loading and unloading. However, the hose flange gaskets of the tanker were damaged due to aging, resulting in carbon nine leaking into the environment. The company immediately invoked its emergency plan.&lt;ref name="jqk" /&gt; According to Quangang District Environmental Protection Bureau, 6.97 tons of carbon nine escaped.&lt;ref name="jqk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jqknews.com/news/93888-Fujian_Quanzhou_carbon_nine_leaks_completed_investigation_of_sea_clearance_enterprises_completed.html|title=Fujian Quanzhou carbon nine leaks: completed investigation of sea clearance enterprises completed|accessdate=2018-11-08|work=jqknews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gyps bengalensis PLoS.png|thumbnail|The white-rumped vulture, one of the species devastated in the crisis]]

Population of three ''Gyps'' vultures in South Asia decreased by about 95% in the 1990s. A major contributing factor in declining populations of vultures is believed to be widespread use of drugs such as [[diclofenac]], once commonly used as a livestock anti-inflammatory drug. Use of diclofenac is now banned in India. The IUCN Red Data Book has listed ''Gyps bengalensis'' as "critically endangered". In winter 2012, 56 vultures in three species ([[Eurasian griffon]], [[cinereous vulture]], [[Egyptian vulture]]) and 10 [[steppe eagle]]s were found dead at [[Jorbeer]] dumping site. Six Eurasian griffons were found dead in May 2013 due to dehydration and wing weakness. The area has been declared as a conserved forest area, but the dead animal dumping site is not part of the protected area. The dramatic vulture decline observed across India presents a range of ecological threats, by influencing the numbers and distribution of other scavenging species. Increased feral dog populations have been reported all over in India, posing many associated disease risks such as rabies to humans and wildlife. India already accounts for a very high incidence of rabies cases, and an absolute shortage of quality anti-rabies vaccine in rural areas can aggravate the problem even further. Similarly, increased crow populations at carcass sites near settlement areas pose a risk of infections to poultry, domesticated birds, and humans. Prevalence and concentration of diclofenac residues in ungulate carcasses is important for India’s threatened vulture populations. A small proportion (&lt; 0.8%) of ungulate carcasses containing lethal levels of diclofenac is enough to cause the observed rapid decline of vultures population. (Bohra D L)

Vultures previously played an important role in public sanitation in India and their disappearance has resulted in a number of problems, and as such numerous conservation schemes are in place to assist in the recovery of vulture populations.

==History==
Vultures in India live in communities and are generally very dependent on human activities. The [[Hindu]] religion, which represents 80% of the country's population,&lt;ref&gt;Indian statistics, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; is particularly favorable to vultures. Cows are considered sacred by majority of Hindus, so cow meat is generally not consumed. This results in the cow's corpse being left to be fed on by vultures. Of the estimated 500 million [[cattle]] in India, only 4% were destined for consumption by humans as meat.&lt;ref&gt;ILC 2003, projection based on Animal Husbandry Statistics, Government of India.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FAO, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Vultures constituted the natural animal disposal system, processing carcasses and nearly 15,000 vultures have been observed at the carcass depositories in capital [[New Delhi]].{{sfn|Greenwood|1938|p=234}}

==Decline==
In the 1990s, a decrease in the number of vultures was noted by Vibhu Prakash of the [[Bombay Natural History Society]], who had monitored vulture populations at [[Keoladeo National Park]].{{sfn|Rana|Prakash|2003|p=116–117}}{{sfn|Prakash|1988|p=614–615}} As the decline accelerated, the international scientific community looked for a reason. There were many difficulties to be overcome because vultures could not legally be killed for scientific study in India and freshly dead animals had become extremely rare, a situation exacerbated by the extremely hot weather in India where temperatures before the monsoon routinely exceed {{convert|40|C|F}}. Andrew Cunningham of the [[Zoological Society of London]] found that the usual suspects of [[pesticide poisoning]], industrial pollutants or bacteria did not show anything abnormal in the vultures he could examine and suspected a new type of toxin exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=McGrath, Susan|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-vanishing-145631290/?all|title=The Vanishing|publisher=''[[Smithsonian Magazine]]''|date=1 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
After work on possible [[virus|viral]] causes of the decline, the culprit was discovered by Dr. Lindsay Oaks and his team at [[The Peregrine Fund]] in 2003 to be diclofenac.{{sfn|Oaks|Donahoe|Rurangirwa|Rideout|Gilbert|Virani|2003|p=630}} Diclofenac is a common [[anti-inflammatory]] [[drug]] administered to livestock and is used to treat the symptoms of [[inflammation]], [[fevers]] and/or pain associated with disease or wounds. It was widely used in India beginning in the 1990s. The drug is fatal to vultures, however, and a vulture is exposed to a mortal dose of diclofenac if it eats from the carcass of an animal that has been treated with diclofenac recently.{{sfn|Oaks|Donahoe|Rurangirwa|Rideout|Gilbert|Virani|2003|p=5909–5912}} A simulation model demonstrated that if only 1% of carcasses were contaminated by diclofenac, Indian vulture populations would fall by between 60% and 90% annually, and a study of carcasses showed that about 10% were contaminated.{{sfn|Green|Newton|Shultz|Cunningham|Gilbert|Pain|Prakash|2004|p=793–800}}

''[[Gyps]]'' species were the most affected by diclofenac.{{sfn|Johnson|2006|p=65}} The population of the [[white-rumped vulture]] (''Gyps bengalensis'') fell 99.7% between 1993 and 2002. The populations of the [[Indian vulture]] (''[[Gyps indicus]]'') and the [[slender-billed vulture]] (''[[Gyps tenuirostris]]'') fell 97.4%. The percentages differ slightly because the white-rumped vulture is more sensitive to diclofenac than the other two species, but all three were in danger of extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Diclofenac effect| pmc=1618889 | pmid=17148382 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0425| volume=2| issue=2 | date=June 2006| journal=Biol. Lett.| pages=279–82 | last1 = Swan | first1 = GE | last2 = Cuthbert | first2 = R | last3 = Quevedo | first3 = M |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other species of ''Gyps'', the [[Himalayan vulture]] (''[[Gyps himalayensis]]'') and the [[Eurasian griffon]] (''[[Gyps fulvus]]'') were less affected, the Eurasian griffon because it only winters in India and has a much smaller initial population, and the Himalayan vulture, with a similarly small population, because it is exclusively mountain-dwelling.{{sfn|Grimmet|Inskipp|Inskipp|1988|p=10}}

==Consequences==
The sudden collapse of the natural animal disposal system in India has had multiple consequences. The carcasses formerly eaten by vultures rot in village fields leading to contaminated drinking water. The disappearance of vultures has allowed other species such as [[rat]] and [[wild dog]] populations to grow. These newly abundant [[scavenger]]s are not as efficient as vultures. A vulture’s [[metabolism]] is a true “dead-end” for pathogens, but dogs and rats become carriers of the pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/48899-vultures-bacteria-microbiome.html|title=Vultures bacteria biome|publisher=livescience.com|access-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; India has an estimated 18 million wild dogs, the largest population of carnivores in the world, which has led to increase in [[leopard]]s invading inhabited areas preying on feral dogs leading to conflicts with humans.

The mammals also carry diseases from rotting carcasses such as [[rabies]], [[anthrax]], [[Plague (disease)|plague]] etc. and are indirectly responsible for thousands of human deaths.{{sfn|Rana|Prakash|2003|p=116}} In India, 30,000 people die from rabies each year, more than half the world's total.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Sudarshan MK|title=Assessing burden of rabies in India|work=WHO sponsored national multi-centric rabies survey|year=2004|publisher=Assoc Prev Control Rabies India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around half a million Indians are treated for rabies each year, at a cost of {{INRconvert|1500}} per person, while the average wage in India is {{INRconvert|120}} per day. According to a study in 2007, the expenses for medical care to treat animal bites cost India {{INRconvert|750|m}} per year. In addition to the cost of care, the government faces the problem of managing the population of disease carriers. Vaccination and sterilization of animals cost money. It is estimated that the decline of vultures costs India {{INRconvert|1.7|t}} per year.

According to [[Parsi]] beliefs, Earth, Fire, and Water are sacred elements, and both cremation and burial are sacrilegious. For the deceased Parsi to reach heaven, vultures serve as intermediaries between earth and sky. The dead body is placed on a [[Tower of Silence]] where vultures, by consuming the body, liberate the soul. Due to the decline in vulture population, Parsis have been obliged to drop these ancient customs for reasons of hygiene, since now bodies take six months to disappear.

Following the findings on diclofenac, the drug was banned for veterinary use in India on March 11, 2006; [[Nepal]] followed suit in August, 2006, and [[Pakistan]] shortly thereafter. A replacement drug was quickly developed and proposed after tests on vultures in captivity: [[meloxicam]]. Meloxicam affects cattle the same way as diclofenac, but is harmless for vultures.{{sfn|Swan|Cuthbert|Quevedo|Green|Pain|Bartels|Cunningham|Duncan|Meharg|Oaks|Parry-Jones|Shultz|Taggart|Verdoorn|Wolter|2006|p=279-282}} Diclofenac for human use was still being diverted into veterinary uses through black markets in certain parts of India as of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mahseerconservancy.com/vulture_monitoring.html|title=Society for Mahseer Conservancy|publisher=mahseerconservancy.com|access-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pasarlapudi blowout'''  was an oil rig blowout that took place on 6.50 pm, 8 January 1995 in [[Pasarlapudi]], near Amalapuram in the East Godavari district of [[Andhra Pradesh]], India. It was the largest blowout ever recorded in the history of the India's oil and natural gas exploration with a fire that engulfed drilling site number 19, rig number E 1400-18GF. The fire continued for 65 days. Initially Neil Adams Fire Fighters(NAF, Houston) was hired to bring fire under control. After ONGC disagreed with their strategy NAF left and it was finally brought under control on 15 March 1995 by International Well Control. The blowout did not cause any casualties, but the [[drilling rig]] was destroyed. Damages to the drilling rig were estimated at Rs 9.2 crore crore as well as about Rs 7 crore of damage to equipment at the well site area.

7 villages within the 2 kilometers radius of the rig, approximately 1,500 people were evacuated immediately by [[APSRTC]] buses. More people fled in panic from the nearby villages.&lt;ref name="iep123"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/content/3413/raging-rig/|title=Raging rig|accessdate=1995-01-30|publisher=Indian Environmental Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bellandur Lake''' is a [[lake]] in the suburb of [[Bellandur]] in the southeast of the city of [[Bangalore|Bengaluru]] and is the largest [[Lakes in Bangalore|lake in the city]]. It was used for landing amphibious aircraft during British rule.It is a part of Bellandur drainage system that drains the southern and the south-eastern parts of the city. The lake is a receptor from three chains of lakes upstream, and has a catchment area of about {{convert|148|km2|acre}}. Water from this lake flows further east to the [[Varthur Lake]], from where it flows down the plateau and eventually into the Pinakani river basin.&lt;ref name="rainwaterharvesting.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainwaterharvesting.org/bellandur/bellandur.htm|title=Bellandur Lake|website=www.RainwaterHarvesting.org|access-date=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently highly polluted with sewage, and in May 2015 the foam covering the water surface caught fire and burned for hours.

The lake caught fire again in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abraham|first1=Mary-Rose|title=Why This Lake Keeps Catching on Fire|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/bangalore-india-lake-bellandur-catches-fire-pollution|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=12 April 2018|date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
Bellandur Lake is believed to be originally a tributary of the Dakshina Pinakini river (also known as the [[Ponnaiyar River]]). The lake itself was constructed during the reign of the [[Western Ganga Dynasty]], who ruled between the 4-5th century to the 10th century CE. Evidences of early human settlement have been excavated along the bed of the Bellandur lake by historian Dr. PV Krishnamurthy. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsable.asianetnews.tv/south/bellandur-lake-on-fire-again-10-historic-facts-you-must-know-about-bengalurus-lake|title=Bellandur lake on fire: 10 facts to know about this heritage lake|website=AsianetNews.tv|access-date=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellandur Lake is a major water body which is located in one of the three main valleys of Bengaluru. It forms a part of the [[Ponnaiyar River]] catchment, and water from Bellandur flows to Varthur Lake, ultimately joining the Pennar River. Currently, most of Bengaluru's treated and untreated sewage is released into Bellandur Lake, severely polluting it, resulting in a depletion of wildlife in and around the lake. Residential and commercial activities in the region have resulted in increasing the silt deposition in the lake and have caused loss of underground water recharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.praja.in/en/projects/2009/09/08/analyze-and-highlight-bellandur-lake-issues|title=Analyze and highlight Bellandur lake issues - Praja|website=www.Praja.in|access-date=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flora and Fauna ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
The Bellandur lake was a prominent catchment area with a good green cover and was a watering hole for the region's numerous, indigenous wildlife. But 30 years of unplanned urbanization have taken a toll on the lake, now several species are gone from the area, including kingfishers, parakeets, wood pigeons, kites, cobras, rat snakes, monitor lizards&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.karnataka.com/bangalore/bellandur-lake/|title=Bellandur Lake, Bangalore – A Lake with Lost Beauty|date=2014-04-21|website=Karnataka.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As more and more large apartment complexes come up on the lakes shores, more such species will disappear.

== Impact of urbanisation ==
[[File:Eutrophication of Lake Bellandur.jpg|thumb|Locals remove the plant cover on a daily basis, but it grows back rapidly, killing fish and aquatic life.]]

The problem goes back to 1980s when unplanned growth broke the chain of tanks and lakes feeding the Bellandur lake. This reduced the amount of rain water reaching the lake to recharge it. The development also resulted in letting in untreated sewage water from housing societies and using the lake surrounding area to dump solid waste. Even industries from surrounding areas started dumping their waste into the lake. found its way into the lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.downtoearth.org.in/coverage/environment/bellandur-lake-a-story-of-toxic-froth-and-fire-57139ref=true|title=Bellandur Lake: a story of toxic froth and fire|website=www.downtoearth.org.in|language=en|access-date=2019-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2017/apr/13/stop-sewage-flow-into-bellandur-lake-national-green-tribunal-1593102.html|title=Stop sewage flow into Bellandur Lake: National Green Tribunal|website=NewIndiaEexpress.com|access-date=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of all these factors has led to a decline in the once robust ecosystem of the lake which now resembles a stinking cesspool. Residents in neighboring areas complain of an odious stench that rises from the lake as a result of uninhibited sewage and chemical dumping from near by industrial units.&lt;ref name="rainwaterharvesting.org"/&gt; The presence of industrial chemicals in the water causes the lake surface to catch fire regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-39968365 |title=The urban farmers battling Bangalore’s concrete jungle |first1=Megan |last1=Devlin |first2=Rohit |last2=Joseph |first3=Prabhu |last3=Mallikarjunan |first4=Romita |last4=Majumdar |first5=Tara |last5=Sutton |publisher=BBC |date=28 May 2017 |access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main source of the problem comes from the fact that the lake doesn’t completely come under any one civic body. The lake is under the jurisdiction of multiple agencies and civic bodies thus leading to lack of accountability&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/water/bengaluru-s-lakes-go-bad-as-authorities-deny-responsibility-49943ref=true|title=Bengaluru’s lakes go bad as authorities deny responsibility|website=www.downtoearth.org.in|language=en|access-date=2019-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Conservation ==
Protests against the pollution and destruction of the lake and its surroundings has been going on for more than 20 years.

1997: Farmers from Bellandur lake and surrounding areas formed an association called Raitha Horata Samithi and started opposing the proposed outer ring road linking ITPL and Electronic City&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bengaluru.citizenmatters.in/491-bellandur-lake-491|title=Desperately seeking revival {{!}}|date=2008-10-02|website=Citizen Matters, Bengaluru|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Same year, environmental activist Ramamurthy along with Jagannath Reddy, Panchayat President and other villagers initiated court proceedings to get BWSSB to clean-up the lake. As a result the STP at the inlet was upgraded. Again in 1997, when Bellandur lake was declared unfit for water sports during National Games, for the first time it drew media attention to the issue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

1999: Ramamurthy filed a PIL in the High Court against the inaction of the government and other government agencies to protect environment and lakes in Bengaluru. The High Court ordered BWSSB to provide proper sewage network in the city to stop sewage from entering lakes. When BWSSB did not follow the court order, the petitioners filed a contempt case. The HC referred the case to Lok Adalat. In 2002, Lok Adalat directed all government departments including BBMP, BDA, BWSSB, Minor Irrigation, KSPCB and Revenue Department to form a committee and look into the status of Bellandur Lake&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

2000: Residents association groups of Koramangala joined in and started lobbying with the government to stop mixing of sewage in storm water drains&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bengaluru.citizenmatters.in/all-you-need-to-know-about-bellandur-lake-and-its-problems-7834|title=All you need to know about Bellandur Lake and its problems {{!}}|date=2015-10-29|website=Citizen Matters, Bengaluru|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

2006: RTI activist C H Ram and M V K Anil kumar filed an RTI application with minor irrigation department. But they never got a response. Between 2006 and 2009, RTI activist Ram Ram filed a number of applications to Tahsildar East, and to the Executive Engineer – Minor Irrigation. He also filed one at the DC (urban) Bangalore District, to know about the illegal encroachments and dumping around the tank&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

2008: Varthur MLA Krishnappa took up the issue and approached the then Chief Minister for intervention&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

2010:  BBMP adopted a Lake Rejuvenation Program. Under this program, the lake received new fencing around its perimeter, few saplings were planted, and the lake was cleaned up.

The government resorted to several initiatives like delivering potable water to villages around Bellandur, introducing baby fish to ensure the livelihood of fisherman is not impacted, planting of sapling in the buffer zone of the lake. However, the main issue of encroachment, emptying of untreated sewage water and industrial waste in to the lakes and illegal solid waste dumping did not stop&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

Several citizens have formed pressure groups and are working both online as well as on ground to save the lake. Significant of them are

1. Sanchita Jha who started an online petition “Clean-up Bellandur Lake” in 2015 to get wider support to the issue. She also started a facebook group called Save Bellandur, Save Bengaluru. The multi-front online campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/why-bellandur-lake-campaign-bengaluru-it-employee-picking-pace-34915|title=Why a Bellandur lake campaign by Bengaluru IT employee is picking pace|date=6 October 2015|website=TheNewsMinute.com|access-date=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; mobilized people of the city, with around fifty thousand petitioners, gaining wide-scale media attention and forcing the CM to direct the authorities to draw up an action plan.

2015: [[D. Kupendra Reddy|Kupendra Reddy]], MP, Rajya Sabha, filed a PIL in the High Court of Karnataka to reduce the pollution in Bellandur lake and restore and rejuvenate it&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deccanherald.com/city/ready-revised-plan-bellandur-681039.html|title=Ready revised plan for Bellandur Lake: HC to agencies|date=2018-07-13|website=Deccan Herald|language=en|access-date=2019-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

2017: Kupendra Reddy raised the Bellandur Lake issue with National Green Tribunal, thus bringing the lakes issue of Bengaluru to NGT’s notice. NGT directed the state government and concerned authorities to prepare an action plan to control and prevent pollution of the Bellandur lake and initiate restoration and rejuvenation process. It also directed the Industries in the catchment area to be closed and the housing societies and upcoming buildings to construct sewage treatment plants (STPs)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/bangalore/others/ngt-gets-tough-over-endangered-bellandur/articleshow/57739927.cms|title=NGT gets tough over endangered Bellandur|last=Mar 21|first=Bangalore Mirror Bureau {{!}} Updated:|last2=2017|website=Bangalore Mirror|language=en|access-date=2019-02-20|last3=Ist|first3=01:00}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

The '''Ashio [[Copper]] [[Mining|Mine]]''', [[Ashio]], [[Tochigi prefecture]], [[Japan]], became very significant from the end of the 19th century to the mid-20th century. It was the site of major [[pollution]] in the 1880s and the scene of the 1907 miners [[riot]]s. During [[World War Two]] the mine was worked by [[POW]] slave labour in dreadful conditions.{{ref |url="https://www.legion.org/honor/234908/we-were-determined-get-home"}}

==History==
The Ashio mine has been in existence at least since 1600 when it belonged to the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. At that time it produced about 1,500 tons annually, although this declined when the mine was closed in 1800. It became privately owned in 1871 following the [[industrialisation]] initiated by the [[Meiji restoration]]. By 1877 it became the property of [[Furukawa Ichibei]], and by the 1880s production had increased dramatically, reaching 4,090 tons by 1885, 78 per cent of the total output of the Furukawa mines and 39 percent of Japan's [[copper mine|copper production]].

The Ashio mine was shut down in 1973.

==Ashio Copper Mine Incident==
The Ashio Copper Mine Incident is the name given to the environmental disaster that occurred as a result of the Ashio mining operations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. From 1880 onwards, people living along the [[Watarase River|Watarase]] and [[Tone River|Tone]] rivers downstream of the mines noticed the water changing colour and the fish dying.&lt;ref&gt;F. G. Notehelfer, 'Japan's First Pollution Incident', ''Journal of Japanese Studies'', 1/2 (1975), p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; Within a decade, the fish population had been almost completely destroyed and around 3000 fishermen in the area were put out of work.&lt;ref&gt;Notehelfer, 'Japan's First Pollution Incident', p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the expansion of the Ashio mines necessitated widespread deforestation to meet the mines' demand for timber. This meant that the towns downstream of the mines lost their flood protection.&lt;ref&gt;Notehelfer, 'Japan's First Pollution Incident', p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; The first major flood resulting from this was in 1890 and it swept down waste from the slag heaps produced by the mines onto the fields, leaving them largely sterile.&lt;ref&gt;Notehelfer, 'Japan's First Pollution Incident', p. 362-3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, a larger flood followed, causing still further environmental damage.&lt;ref&gt;G. McCormack, 'Modernity, Water, and the Environment in Japan', in W. M. Tsutsui (ed), ''A Companion to Japanese History'', p. 446&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897, after considerable delays, the Japanese government decided to act and [[Furukawa Group|Furukawa Corporation]], the company running the mine, began to build filtration systems to reduce the problem of pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Notehelfer, 'Japan's First Pollution Incident', p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; After resigning from the [[National Diet]], ex-representative [[Shozo Tanaka]] attempted to deliver a letter of appeal directly to the Emperor himself who was leaving the national Diet. While Tanaka was prevented from handing out the letter, the content of the letter was published by national newspapers, helping to publicise the plight of residents, which prompted the government to act. However the problem did not immediately go away, and protests continued for some years.&lt;ref&gt;Notehelfer, 'Japan's First Pollution Incident', p. 376&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, the government passed the Factory Law which was Japan's first law to address industrial pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Imura|first=Hidefumi|title=Environmental Policy in Japan|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|page=18|year=2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t3_pgPtf-QoC&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=November 8, 2013|isbn=978-1-78100-824-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Watarase Yusuichi Pond' was created to ease mineral pollution caused by the Ashio incident, and later became [[list of Ramsar sites in Japan|one of national Ramsar sites]].

Due to [[lawsuit]]s, [[publicity]], and other actions against the corporations responsible for the pollution, as well as the creation of the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Environmental Agency]] in 1971, increased public awareness, and changes in industrial practices, the incidence of these kinds of diseases declined after the 1970s. These cases also set precedents for private tort law and civil law in issues of compensation for technology-related mass damage which continue to have repercussions in legal cases in Japan today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kawamura|first=Hiroki|date=2018|title=The relation between law and technology in Japan: liability for technology-related mass damage in the cases of Minamata disease, asbestos, and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|journal=Contemporary Japan|volume=30|issue=1|pages=3–27|doi=10.1080/18692729.2018.1423459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Itai-itai disease ==
Itai-itai disease first occurred in 1912 within [[Toyama Prefecture]]. This disease was given the name "itai-itai" because this was the phrase victims would frequently cry out; it translates into "it-hurts it-hurts disease".

=== Cause of itai-itai ===
The cause of itai-itai disease was determined to be [[cadmium poisoning]] in the [[drinking water]] from the [[Jinzū River]] basin. The source of cadmium was discovered to be from [[Mitsui Mining and Smelting Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wound Left by the Sharp Knife of Industrial Pollution|url=http://www1.wlsh.tyc.edu.tw/~globalschoolnet/a6.html|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitsui Mining began to discharge cadmium into the Jinzū River in 1910. The cadmium poisoned the river, thus poisoning locals' source of water. Any person who drank that water or ate food that was grown with the contaminated water, such as rice, would be likely to show signs of itai-itai disease.

=== Symptoms of itai-itai ===
The first symptoms were spine and leg pain. However, as the disease progresses symptoms include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Joshua W.|title=What is ouch ouch or Itai itai disease?|url=http://www.accessscience.com/studycenter.aspx?main=9&amp;questionID=4978|publisher=McGraw Hill Education|accessdate=10 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113021200/http://www.accessscience.com/studycenter.aspx?main=9&amp;questionID=4978|archivedate=13 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*debilitating [[pain]]
*[[bone fractures]] from mild traumas or activities (e.g., coughing or walking)
*skeletal deformities
*[[anemia]]
*[[kidney disorders]]

=== Aftermath of itai-itai ===
Most victims of itai-itai disease were confined to bed because walking caused severe pain. Residents of the surrounding area that were harmed by this disease filed a lawsuit against Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting Company in 1968. Residents won this lawsuit and began to conduct negotiations. Mitsui Mining formally admitted that itai-itai disease was caused by their discharge of cadmium into the Jinzū River. Mitsui Mining was also obliged to pay recovery costs for the land. This meant that they had to ensure the poisoned land was returned to a safe and cultivable state.

== Minamata disease ==
The first report of [[Minamata disease]] originated in [[Minamata]] in [[Kumamoto Prefecture]] in the year 1956. Many of the earliest patients became insane from the symptoms and in some cases died within a month of being afflicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Things to know about Minamata Disease|url=http://soshisha.org/english/10tishiki_e/10chishiki_e.htm|publisher=The Minamata Environmental Creation Development Project Steering Committee|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an extensive investigation, the Minamata disease was identified as a heavy metal poisoning, specifically [[mercury poisoning|methylmercury poisoning]], transmitted by the ingestion of contaminated fish from [[Minamata Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minamata Disease The History and Measures|url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/chemi/hs/minamata2002/index.html|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[methylmercury]] inside the contaminated fish attacked the afflicted patient’s [[central nervous system]], which caused a variety of symptoms.

=== Symptoms of Minamata disease===
*numbing in the arms and legs
*impairment of balance
*fatigue
*[[ringing in the ears]]
*[[tunnel vision]]
*[[loss of hearing]]
*decrease in communication skills (slurred speech)
Most patients exhibited combinations of symptoms and did not show all symptoms.
[[Taiji dolphin drive hunt#Health risks|National-institute-for-minamata-disease says 182 taiji-residents have extremely-high-mercury-level but do not display any symptoms of mercury-poisoning.]]

=== Chisso Corporation ===
The cause of this contamination in Minamata bay was then traced back to [[Chisso Corporation]]’s dumping of [[methylmercury]] into Minamata Bay. Chisso Corporation produced [[acetaldehyde]] using [[water]], [[acetylene]], [[mercury(II) sulfate]] as a catalyst and [[manganese dioxide]] or since August 1951, [[ferric sulfide]] as a co-catalyst. [[Acetaldehyde]] reacts with [[acetic anhydride]] in order to produce [[ethylidene diacetate]], which is heated to produce [[vinyl acetate]]. [[Acetaldehyde]] was also used to produce [[acetic acid]] by oxidizing acetaldehyde and [[vinyl chloride]], 
which is [[polymerized]] to make [[PVC]]; however, the use of ferric sulfide had a downside: methylmercury (or organic mercury) was a by-product in the making of these chemicals due to its use. The methylmercury was then dumped into Minamata Bay as chemical waste. Chisso decided not to stop the use of the mentioned catalysts or the dumping of their byproducts into the bay until 1966. Today, Chisso makes compensation payments to all certified (recognized) patients of Minamata disease. Over 50 hectares of the bay were reclaimed, using the contaminated sludge from the bottom of the bay with a non-contaminated layer of soil on top.

=== Aftermath of Minamata disease ===
In 1970, the [[Japanese Water Pollution Control Act]], which states that all factories are required by law to regulate disposal of dangerous chemicals, was enacted. In 1977, the Japanese government took on the task of cleaning Minamata Bay by vacuuming out 1.5&amp;nbsp;million cubic metres of methylmercury-contaminated sludge from the bottom of the bay and using them to reclaim over 50 hectares of the bay along with non-contaminated soil on top. Then in 1997, after fourteen years and $359&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griesbauer|first=Laura|title=The Minamata Bay Incident|url=http://www.csa.com/discoveryguides/mercury/review5.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Governor of Kumamoto Prefecture deemed Minamata Bay safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pollack|first=Andrew|title=Japan Call Mercury-Poisoned Bay Safe Now|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/30/world/japan-calls-mercury-poisoned-bay-safe-now.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Niigata Minamata disease ==
In 1965, a number of patients in [[Niigata Prefecture]] exhibited signs of Minamata disease. Niigata Minamata was caused by [[methylmercury]] poisoning in the Agano River basin. However, this second outbreak of Minamata disease was discovered early on. The degree of this outbreak was minimal{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=April 2014}} compared to that of the first Minamata disease that took place in [[Kumamoto prefecture]]. Investigation of the cause of the disease was given to the [[Niigata University]] medical department. There were a number of factors that could be the cause of this outbreak. Along the Agano River basin there were several plants that used mercury in production, agricultural chemicals were widely used in the area, and the last possible cause of the outbreak was said to be the cause of an earthquake that took place a year before the disease was discovered in Niigata.

=== Symptoms of Niigata Minamata disease ===
As the name implies, Niigata Minamata disease is similar to Minamata disease; they both share the similar symptoms:
* numbness in the arms and legs
* impairment of balance
* fatigue
* ringing in the ears
* tunnel vision
* loss of hearing
* decrease in communication skills

=== Showa Denko ===
In the spring of 1966, the research team determined the most likely cause to the dumping of methylmercury from [[Showa Denko]] Corporation factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/uu35ie/uu35ie0d.htm|title=VII. Rediscovery of the Minamata disease in Niigata|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Showa Denko was located upstream on the Agano River and, just like the Chisso corporation, produced methylmercury as a by-product and then dumped it into the Agano river. Much like Chisso corporation, Showa Denko declined all charges that they were at fault for the Niigata Minamata outbreak.

=== Aftermath of Niigata Minamata disease ===
After much controversy, Showa Denko was found guilty of negligence and was then forced to pay compensation payments to all victims of Niigata Minamata disease. In the year that Niigata Minamata was discovered, 26 people were designated disease patients, and five died as a result of the methylmercury poisoning.

== Yokkaichi asthma==
[[Yokkaichi]] is a city in the center of Japan in [[Mie Prefecture]]; known as the "town of petroleum" as it produces almost a quarter of the total petroleum in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIR POLLUTION IN YOKKAICHI AREA WITH SPECIAL REGARDS TO THE PROBLEM OF "YOKKAICHI -ASTHMA|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/indhealth1963/2/2/2_2_87/_pdf|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the first oil refinery in this area first began in 1955&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIR POLLUTION IN YOKKAICHI AREA WITH SPECIAL REGARDS TO THE PROBLEM OF "YOKKAICHI -ASTHMA"|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/indhealth1963/2/2/2_2_87/_pdf|publisher=Department of Public Health, School of Medicine, Mie Prefectural University, Torii-cho, Tsu, Mie-Ken}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and after construction many respiratory diseases emerged within the city and among neighboring districts.

=== Cause of Yokkaichi asthma ===
In the middle of this city was the largest heavy oil-fired power station and refinery in Japan during this time period. Unfortunately, this refinery was not equipped with machines that could lower the [[sulfur dioxide]] emissions before releasing them into the air. In the early 1960s, respiratory diseases began to emerge in the general population of Yokkaichi and even in some neighboring districts. This increase in respiratory problems was then specified as [[Yokkaichi asthma]]. This form of asthma was prevalent within Yokkaichi — 5–10% of inhabitants aged 40 in Yokkaichi were reported to suffer from chronic bronchitis, whereas less than 3% suffered from the same disease in non-polluted areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Mortality and life expectancy of Yokkaichi Asthma patients, Japan:   Late effects of air pollution in 1960–70s|journal=Environmental Health|volume=7|pages=8|doi=10.1186/1476-069X-7-8|pmid=18302742|pmc=2311286|year=2008|last1=Guo|first1=Peng|last2=Yokoyama|first2=Kazuhito|last3=Suenaga|first3=Masami|last4=Kida|first4=Hirotaka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Yokkaichi asthma relief system ===
To offer support for many of the victims of this disease, a public release system for air pollution was established in 1965. This set forth that all people in the Yokkaichi area who met the following criteria were paid by the program:
#Specific diseases such as bronchial  asthma, chronic  bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema, and their complications.
#In specific areas where the prevalence of that disease has increased.
#Three years of residence within the specified area.
Today, there are many laws regulating the amount of sulfur dioxide a factory can release into the air. These laws help keep the disaster of Yokkaichi Asthma from happening once again within Japan's borders.

The '''Jinkanpo Atsugi Incinerator''' was a waste [[Incineration|incinerator]] located in [[Ayase, Kanagawa|Ayase]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], [[Japan]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/2000-02/22/035r-022200-idx.html|title=Blowing Smoke in Japan|website=www.washingtonpost.com|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; operated by Enviro-Tech (formerly Shinkampo).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2000/March/145civ.htm|title=#145: 03-27-00 JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FILES SUIT AGAINST JAPANESE COMPANY OVER AIR POLLUTION AT U.S. NAVY BASE NEAR TOKYO|last=|first=|date=2000-03-27|website=|publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]]|access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began operation in the 1980s and was closed in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asph.sc.edu/news/feigley.htm|title=Feigley testifies on Navy study’s finding|website=www.asph.sc.edu|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incinerator was near [[Naval Air Facility Atsugi]], a base manned partly by several thousand [[United States Navy]] members and their families.

Throughout its history, the incinerator reportedly blew toxic and cancerous emissions over the neighbouring base facilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2001/02/12/life/u-s-sues-atsugi-incinerator-operator/|title=U.S. sues Atsugi incinerator operator|last=Hesse|first=Stephen|date=2001-02-12|newspaper=The Japan Times Online|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incinerator's owners, arrested and jailed for charges of [[tax evasion]], neglected the maintenance of the facility. The pollution had become so much of a health concern for the American residents that if they showed signs of adverse health effects, the U.S. military authorities allowed them to leave early (usually servicemembers are stationed at the base for a tour of three years). Many U.S. service members reported sickness and a few died from [[cancer]] shortly after moving back to the [[United States]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/clearing-the-air-around-atsugi-incinerator-1.71273|title=Clearing the air around Atsugi incinerator|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, The US Navy has not established connection between their exposure and their disease. For a time, the base required service members to undergo medical screenings before being stationed at the base in order to ensure that they had no medical condition that would be worsened by the poor air quality.

In May 2001, the Japanese government purchased the plant for nearly 40 million dollars and shut it down following a [[United States Department of Justice]] lawsuit against the private incinerator owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20010421b1.html |title=Compensation deal reached with incinerator firm {{!}} The Japan Times Online |date=2007-09-29 |access-date=2016-08-16 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929122813/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20010421b1.html |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dismantling was completed by the end of that year. Some former residents of Atsugi NAF still complain of health problems related to the incinerator's emissions and report that the USN has been reluctant to address their concerns.  The incinerator contaminated the base, especially the housing area, with dioxin, heavy metals, and other deadly toxins. In June, 2007, the USN's Environmental Health Center announced that it would conduct a study of the health population of those stationed at NAF Atsugi during the time the incinerator was in operation.

The Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center has stated that a new health study is currently underway and should be released in the summer of 2009.

'''{{nihongo|Niigata Minamata disease|新潟水俣病|Niigata Minamata-byō}}''' is a [[neurological]] syndrome caused by severe [[mercury poisoning]]. Identical in symptoms to the original outbreak of [[Minamata disease]] in [[Kumamoto Prefecture]], the second outbreak in [[Niigata Prefecture]] was confirmed with the same name in 1965. The disease was caused by severe [[mercury poisoning]], the source of which was [[methylmercury]] released in the [[wastewater]] from [[mercury(II) sulfate|mercury sulfate]]-catalysed [[acetaldehyde]] production at the [[Showa Denko|Showa Electrical Company]]'s chemical plant in [[Kanose, Niigata|Kanose village]]. This highly [[toxic]] compound was released untreated into the [[Agano River]] where it [[bioaccumulate]]d up the food chain, [[mercury in fish|contaminating fish]] which when eaten by local people caused symptoms including [[ataxia]], [[numbness]] in the hands and feet, general [[muscle weakness]], narrowing of the [[field of vision]] and damage to hearing and speech.

690 people from the [[Agano River]] basin have been certified as patients of Niigata Minamata disease.&lt;ref&gt;Official government figure as of March 2001. See [http://www.env.go.jp/en/chemi/hs/minamata2002/ch2.html "Minamata Disease: The History and Measures, ch2"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Niigata outbreak was the second recorded in [[Japan]] and occurred in the Lower [[Agano River]] Basin, it is sometimes called {{nihongo|Second Minamata disease|第二水俣病|Dai-ni Minamata-byō}} or {{nihongo|Agano River Organic Mercury Poisoning|阿賀野川有機水銀中毒|Agano-gawa Yūki-suigin Chūdoku}}. It is one of the [[Four Big Pollution Diseases of Japan]].

==History==
===Discovery===

The second outbreak of Minamata disease in Niigata Prefecture was discovered in a very similar way to the original outbreak in [[Kumamoto Prefecture]]. From the autumn of 1964 to the spring of 1965, cats living along the banks of the [[Agano River]] had been seen to go mad and die: "...one cat ran into a small clay cooking stove containing burning charcoal. With the pupils of its eyes dilated, salivating, convulsing and uttering a strange cry, the cat breathed its last breath." These strange symptoms eventually began to appear in people, too. Professor Tadao Tsubaki of [[Niigata University]] examined two patients in April and May 1965 and suspected Minamata disease. One patient's hair was found to have a mercury level of 390 [[Parts per million|ppm]]. On 31 May, he reported an outbreak of [[organic compound|organic]] [[mercury poisoning]] in the Agano River basin to the prefectural government and made his findings public on 12 June.&lt;ref name=Harada1&gt;Harada, pp86-91&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation===
Throughout 1965 and 1966, researchers from the [[Kumamoto University]] Research Group (that had been set up to investigate the original outbreak) and Dr. [[Hajime Hosokawa]] (the former [[Chisso]] hospital director) brought their significant experience from Minamata and applied it to the Niigata outbreak. Many lessons were learned from Minamata and the investigation into the cause of the outbreak proceeded much more smoothly than it had in Minamata. The prefectural government, Niigata University, citizen's organisations, and local people all worked together to uncover the cause. In March 1966, factory plant [[wastewater]] was reported to be suspected as the source of pollution, and in September, the [[Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare|Ministry of Health and Welfare]] announced it had discovered [[methylmercury]] in [[moss]] at the outlet of the [[Showa Denko]] factory in [[Kanose, Niigata|Kanose village]].&lt;ref name=Harada1/&gt;

===Response of Showa Denko===
Showa Denko responded to the outbreak of Niigata Minamata disease in a similar way that Chisso had responded in Minamata: by attempting to discredit the researchers while proposing their own theory. The company issued information leaflets that rejected their wastewater as the cause of the disease and suggested the cause might have been an "agricultural chemical run-off" that entered the river after the [[1964 Niigata earthquake]].

===Patients' lawsuit===
Unlike their counterparts in Minamata, the victims of Showa Denko's pollution lived a considerable distance from the factory and had no particular link to the company. As a result, the local community was much more supportive of patients' groups and a lawsuit was filed against the company in March 1968. The Niigata lawsuit was filed only three years after the outbreak had been made public in 1965. In contrast, the first lawsuit filed in Minamata happened in 1969, 13 years after the original outbreak was discovered.

On 26 September 1968, the government announced its official conclusion as to the cause of Niigata Minamata disease. The report said, although "the circumstances of the poisoning are extremely complex, and they are difficult to reproduce", the mercury had probably been discharged from the Kanose plant over a long period of time. However, the report did not rule out other causes and Showa Denko's president, [[Masao Yasunishi]], insisted the company was not the cause of the outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;George, p187&lt;/ref&gt;

The Niigata lawsuit was ultimately successful, and on 29 September 1971, the court found Showa Denko guilty of negligence. Families of deceased and congenital patients received [[JPY]]10 million, surviving patients were awarded between JPY1 million and 10 million depending on symptoms, JPY400,000 to those contaminated by mercury, and JPY300,000 were awarded to pregnant women who had been told to have abortions due to the danger posed to their unborn children.&lt;ref&gt;George, pp246-247&lt;/ref&gt;

A family member of the deceased patient testified in court, "My father was crazed like a wild beast and then died—agonized, in pain... like a dog."

The events in Niigata catalysed a change in response to the original Minamata incident. The scientific research carried out in Niigata forced a re-examination of that done in Minamata and the decision of Niigata patients to sue the polluting company allowed the same response to be considered in Minamata. [[Masazumi Harada]] has said, "It may sound strange, but if this second Minamata disease had not broken out, the medical and social progress achieved by now in Kumamoto... would have been impossible."&lt;ref&gt;Harada, p90&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Toroku arsenic disease'''|土呂久砒素公害|Toroku hiso kōgai}} was a disease resulting from air and water pollution from a refinery at a mine at Toroku, located in [[Takachiho, Miyazaki|Takachiho]], [[Nishiusuki District, Miyazaki|Nishiusuki District]], [[Miyazaki Prefecture|Miyazaki]], [[Japan]].

It emitted [[arsenic]]-containing air, resulting in patients with chronic [[arsenic poisoning]] producing skin changes, [[skin cancer]]s and sometimes [[lung cancer]]. The Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd., which bought the right of mining was sued by the patients for health damage, but 15 years later, the lawsuit ended with a compromise.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==History==
The pollution at Toroku dates back to 1690 according to [[A Table of Public Hazards of Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;Chronological Table of Public Hazards and Occupational Disease(1977), edited by Iijima N. Kouga  Taisaku  Gijutu Douyuukai, Tokyo {{full|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Between 1920 and 1941, and between 1955 and 1962, arsenic production was conducted at a refinery which produced smoke staying deep in V-shaped valleys. Workers and inhabitants developed chronic arsenic poisoning, and 5 died in a family of 7 in succession.
*In 1925, horses and cows died possibly due to pollution, recorded a veterinary doctor.
*In 1967, the right of mining went from a small factory to Sumitomo Metal Mining Company.
*On December 8, 1970, Tsurue Sato sought advice at a branch of the  Legal Affairs Bureau.
*On November 13, 1971, elementary school teacher Masa Saito published the presence of health damage by the refinery after meeting Tsurue Sato.
*The response of Miyazaki Prefecture was quick; however, the response at first tried to underestimate the damage.
*This case was brought to court against the Sumitomo Mining Company and the trial started in 1975.  It ended in 1990 with a compromise.

==Medical examinations==
Seven patients were examined extensively at [[Kumamoto University]], and they were diagnosed as having chronic arsenic poisoning due to pollution, in a report published in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura I et al. "Chronic arsenic poisoning, Cases around Toroku mine".(1973) Report 1 and Report 2. ''J Kumamoto Med Soc''. 47,486-515,516-530.&lt;/ref&gt; The same team increased the number of patients to 48 in 1976, while Hotta and his co-workers made extensive studies of the pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Hotta et al. "Clinical studies on Toroku pollution disease." (1979) ''Taishitsu Igaku enkyusho Houkoku''  29,199-235.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms of patients in Toroku pollution==

===Skin and otorhinolaryngological symptoms===
Nakamura et al. characterized the condition by pigmentation which is either macular or diffuse, appearing both in covered and exposed areas. Punctate depigmentation appears in raindrop shapes, and hard keratoses are either localized or diffuse. Malignant changes may occur. They pointed out [[nasal septum]] defects. The environmental agency first indicated the skin and ENT findings of nasal scar or septum defect as necessary symptoms for the Toroku Pollution.

===Other symptoms===
In addition to the skin and ENT findings, neuritis was added as a criterion of chronic arsenic poisoning. [[Bowen's disease]], [[Lung cancer]], and cancer of the urinary organ were added as appearing following chronic arsenic poisoning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15404">{{Main|Minamata disease}}

The '''Minamata disease compensation agreements of 1959''' were agreed between the polluting [[Chisso]] company and representative groups of fishermen and Minamata disease patients who had been affected by mercury pollution. The agreements and their formation shared a number of common characteristics. They were formulated outside the legal system, by ad-hoc mediation committees specially established for the purpose. Members of the committees and the final agreements were weighted in favour of Chisso and all included punitive clauses that the groups could make no future claims for compensation against the company.

== Compensation of fishermen ==

Ever since 1908 when Chisso opened the factory in Minamata wastewater had been dumped into the seas around Minamata, particularly into [[Minamata Bay]] via the waste canal outlet in [[Hyakken Harbour]]. Damage to fisheries was inevitable and the Minamata Fishing Cooperative had demanded compensation from the company on two occasions previous to the outbreak of Minamata disease. After direct negotiations in 1926 the company agreed to pay "sympathy money" to the cooperative of [[JPY]]1,500 ([[USD]]704). By using the term {{nihongo|"sympathy money"|見舞い金|mimaikin}} the company avoided accepting responsibility for the damage and sought to prevent further claims by including a clause in the agreement that the cooperative would "never again lodge complaints" against Chisso. This pattern of denial of responsibility and the inclusion of punitive clauses repeated itself again and again in Chisso's dealings with complainants. The pollution continued unabated and another agreement was signed in 1943. This time the cooperative was paid [[JPY]]152,500 in compensation for future and past damage to fishing. The cooperative was also forced to acknowledge Chisso's "importance to the prosperity of Minamata" and "the need to cooperate so as not to harm its operations", indicating the unequal nature of the agreement.

[[File:Minamata fishing.jpg|thumb|left|Fishing in Minamata Bay (''[[W. E. Smith]]'')]]

===The Minamata Fishing Cooperative===

By the time of the outbreak of Minamata disease the fishing situation had become critical. From 1953 to 1957 the fish catch in Minamata had declined by a staggering 91%.&lt;ref&gt;George, p. 72 - Table 3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, the Kumamoto prefectural government had attempted to limit the spread of the disease by banning the ''sale'' of fish caught from Minamata Bay, but did not issue and all-out ban. This left fishermen with fish they could not sell, but no financial assistance to compensate their losses. In September 1958 the '''Minamata Fishing Cooperative''' petitioned the prefecture to ban fishing completely so that their members might be properly compensated under the [[Fisheries Law]] and [[Food Sanitation Act]]. The government did not respond and only advised the fishermen against consumption of the fish and shellfish they caught from the bay. However, with no source of income, many fishermen were left with no choice but to eat the suspect fish they caught. In fact, throughout the history of the Minamata disease problem, the catching of fish from Minamata Bay has never been legally prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;George, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the ban on the sale of contaminated fish, there was still widespread suspicion amongst local people that fish caught in the Minamata area was unsafe and by June 1959 several fish shops had gone out of business from plummeting demand. Desperate, and with no assistance from government, the cooperative was forced into direct negotiations with the company. On 6 August 400 members of the cooperative marched on the factory and in a hostile atmosphere met with factory manager [[Eiichi Nishida]]. The fishermen's demand for the cleanup of Minamata Bay, the installation of wastewater treatment facilities and [[JPY]]100 million ([[USD]]278,000) was met with an offer of "emergency sympathy money" to the value of [[JPY]]500,000 ([[USD]]1,390) and a promise to consult with the company's head office in [[Tokyo]].

Fishermen from the cooperative again forced their way into the factory on 12 August to continue negotiations. No agreement could be reached but the two sides did manage to agree to a joint inspection of fishing conditions in Minamata Bay, followed by further talks on 17 August. After this inspection Chisso admitted that fishing was impossible in some areas and made a final offer of [[JPY]]13 million ([[USD]]36,100). This paltry sum incensed the fishermen. Violence broke out, riot police were called and Nishida and other company employees were effectively held hostage in the factory building. Only after Mayor [[Todomu Nakamura]] agreed to mediate between the two sides did the fishermen leave the factory grounds. The mediation committee formed by Mayor Nakamura was stacked heavily in Chisso's favour and presented a decision on 26 August. The company would pay [[JPY]]20 million ([[USD]]55,600) directly to the cooperative and set up a [[JPY]]15 million ([[USD]]41,700) fund to promote the recovery of fishing. The proposal was qualified with the ultimatum that if either side rejected, the committee would stop mediation completely. On 29 August the fishing cooperative delivered its response: "In order to end the anxiety of the citizens, we swallow our tears and accept". The company also agreed and the first compensation agreement between Chisso and fisherman was complete.&lt;ref&gt;George, pp. 76–81&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Kumamoto Prefectural Alliance of Fishing Cooperatives===

To the company's disappointment, this first agreement did not bring an end to problems with fishermen. Since Chisso had switched the wastewater output from Minamata Bay to the mouth of Minamata River in September 1958 the environmental damage had spread even further up and down the [[Shiranui Sea]]. Cats had started to die in [[Ashikita, Kumamoto|Ashikita]] to the north and in [[Izumi, Kagoshima|Izumi]] to the south of Minamata and new Minamata disease patients were also appearing. The pollution was having a widespread effect on fishing catches and fish sales as people's confidence in the safety of their food evaporated. This drove the '''Kumamoto Prefectural Alliance of Fishing Cooperatives''' to take action of a similar pattern to that taken by the Minamata Fishing Alliance earlier in the year, but on a larger scale. On 17 October, 1,500 fishermen from the alliance descended on the factory demanding direct negotiations with Chisso. When company officials refused, the fishermen forced their way into the factory and attacked the security office, breaking windows and injuring seven guards. Alliance president [[Ushita Murakami]] delivered their demands to company manager [[Eiichi Nishida|Nishida]], who promised a prompt reply. When the response came, the company said that since the factory's waste had still not been proven as the cause of Minamata disease, and it could offer the fishermen nothing.

Unsatisfied, Murakami and followers travelled to Tokyo and met with officials of numerous government departments to outline their plight. He managed to secure a promise from members of the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] that they would visit Minamata to investigate the situation. When the Diet party arrived in Minamata on 2 November they were met by a crowd of 4,000 demonstrators (including fishermen and disease victims groups alike) outside the Municipal Hospital. The crowd was extremely respectful to the Diet members and pleaded with them for help. The members thanked the demonstrators for bringing the issue to the attention of the national government and promised they would do all they could.

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Minamata protesters.jpg|thumb|right|Protestors at the gates of the Chisso factory (''[[W. E. Smith]]'')]] --&gt;

Emboldened after their demonstration at the hospital, the alliance fishermen marched on the factory to again demand negotiations. The company refused and the fishermen forced their way in and rioted, attacking many buildings and significantly damaging company property. Riot police arrived and serious fighting continued sporadically for the rest of the day until the fishermen dispersed around 9 pm. Injuries included 30-40 fishermen, two company employees, factory manager Nishida himself, 64 policemen and the chief of police. Damages to company property amounted to [[JPY]]10 million ([[USD]]27,800).&lt;ref&gt;George, pp. 81–101&lt;/ref&gt; Before the riot the Minamata disease issue had been skirted by the national media and had been chiefly a local issue. The violent riot however was covered widely in the national media and for the first time since the discovery of the disease in 1956 the issue of Minamata disease had nationwide coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Ui, Chapter 4 - section V&lt;/ref&gt;

A mediation committee headed by [[Kumamoto Prefecture]] Governor [[Hirosaku Teramoto]] was formed to hammer out a solution. At a meeting on 2 December the prefectural fishing alliance outlined their demands: compensation of [[JPY]]2.5 billion ([[USD]]6.9 million) for damage to fishing since 1953, the temporary closure of the factory and removal of toxic sludge. The committee then met company executives, including Chisso president [[Kiichi Yoshioka]], who responded with an offer that amounted to "nearly zero". After weeks of wrangling the fishing alliance reduced its demands to [[JPY]]980 million ([[USD]]2.7 million) and Chisso, under increasing pressure from all sides, relaxed its position. The proposed agreement (presented with the ultimatum of no further mediation from the committee should it be rejected, as previously) called for the immediate installation of wastewater treatment facilities, [[JPY]]35 million compensation to be paid to the alliance ([[JPY]]10 million of which would be deducted to cover the damage caused in the 2 November riots) and a [[JPY]]65 million fund for the recovery of the fishing industry. The agreement also included a clause that the alliance could never demand further compensation, even if the factory's waste was proven to be the cause of the damage. The agreement was accepted by both sides on 17 December.

== Compensation of victims ==

In 1959, the victims of Minamata disease and their families were in a much weaker position than the fisherman who had extracted at least some "sympathy money" from Chisso. The only patients' organisation present at the time of the fishermen's agreements was the '''Minamata Disease Patients Families Mutual Aid Society''', which had only been established in August 1957. They were much fewer in number (in November 1959 the society only represented the 58 families of 78 patients) and the membership of the society was more divided than the relatively united fishermen. One factor driving the division of the patients was the [[discrimination]] and [[ostracism]] some families were experiencing in the Minamata community. Local people, who were naturally averse to uncleanliness and disease, felt that the company (and their city that depended upon it) was facing economic ruin under the pressure of the various groups making demands of it. Even fishermen, who were fellow victims of the company's pollution, discriminated against disease victims because they were stoking fears that prevented the sale of their fish. To some patients this ostracisim from the community represented a greater fear than the disease itself.

In a similar fashion to the fishermen's associations, the Mutual Aid Society began by petitioning the city and prefectural governments and visited [[Kumamoto, Kumamoto|Kumamoto]] city on 21 November. When their petitions produced no results, the society approached Chisso directly and demanded compensation of [[JPY]]234 million ([[USD]]650,000) – [[JPY]]3 million ([[USD]]8,300) per person. On 28 November the company replied that the link between the factory's wastewater and Minamata disease had not been proven and could, therefore, offer them nothing but an expression of sympathy. The society began a [[sit-in]] at the company gates, which was to last a whole month.

Around 50 members of the society travelled to Kumamoto on 1 December and made a request to Governor [[Hirosaku Teramoto|Teramoto]] to include the patients' request for compensation with the mediation that was ongoing with the prefectural fishing alliance. He agreed to consult with the company and when the mediation committee presented its deal to the fishing alliance on 16 December, it also presented a proposal for "sympathy" payments to the Mutual Aid Society, even though no representatives had been present on the mediation committee. The proposal amounted to a total compensation package of [[JPY]]74 million. The money would be allocated to patients certified by a committee to be established by the [[Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare|Ministry of Health and Welfare]] as follows: adult patients would receive [[JPY]]100,000 ([[USD]]278) and children [[JPY]]10,000 ([[USD]]28) per year; families of dead patients would receive a [[JPY]]320,000 ([[USD]]889) payment. Society leader [[Eizō Watanabe]] agreed that the overall level of compensation was acceptable but rejected the plan over the staggered schedule of payments and the very small sum being offered for child victims.

The mediation committee reconvened on 25 December and agreed to increase the child payments to [[JPY]]30,000 ([[USD]]83) per child. The Mutual Aid Society held a vote of its members but the agreement was rejected by a single vote. Society leader Watanabe offered his resignation in protest but when another vote was held on 27 December members accepted the agreement and his resignation was withdrawn. As usual, the agreement did not admit responsibility for Minamata disease. The payments were "sympathy money" and the agreement included a clause that, "Even if in the future it is determined that the cause of Minamata disease ''is'' the factory's wastewater, [the patients] will make absolutely no further demands for compensation", along with an extra clause that, "If in the future it is determined that the cause of Minamata disease is ''not'' the factory's wastewater, the company shall end payments at the end of that month." The final agreement was accepted by both sides on 29 December 1959.&lt;ref&gt;George, pp. 102–113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kawamura|first=Hiroki|date=2018|title=The relation between law and technology in Japan: liability for technology-related mass damage in the cases of Minamata disease, asbestos, and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|journal=Contemporary Japan|volume=30 |issue=1|pages=3–27|doi=10.1080/18692729.2018.1423459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Minamata disease'''|水俣病|Minamata-byō|lead=yes}}, sometimes referred to as {{nihongo|'''Chisso-Minamata disease'''|チッソ水俣病|Chisso-Minamata-byō}}, is a [[neurology|neurological]] syndrome caused by severe [[mercury poisoning]]. Signs and symptoms include [[ataxia]], [[numbness]] in the hands and feet, general [[muscle weakness]], [[Tunnel vision|loss of peripheral vision]], and damage to [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]] and [[Manner of articulation|speech]]. In extreme cases, [[insanity]], [[paralysis]], [[coma]], and [[death]] follow within weeks of the onset of symptoms. A [[congenital]] form of the disease can also affect [[fetus]]es in the womb.

Minamata disease was first discovered in [[Minamata, Kumamoto|Minamata]] city in [[Kumamoto prefecture]], [[Japan]], in 1956. It was caused by the release of [[methylmercury]] in the industrial [[wastewater]] from the [[Chisso Corporation]]'s chemical factory, which continued from 1932 to 1968. This highly [[toxic]] chemical [[Bioaccumulation|bioaccumulated]] in shellfish and fish in [[Minamata Bay]] and the [[Shiranui Sea]], which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, the government and company did little to prevent the pollution. The animal effects were severe enough in cats that they came to be named as having "dancing cat fever".&lt;ref name="withrow"&gt;Stephen J. Withrow, David M. Vail, ''Withrow and MacEwen's Small Animal Clinical Oncology'', Elsevier: 2007, {{ISBN|0721605583}}, p. 73-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)&lt;ref name=officialnumbers&gt;Official government figure as of March 2001. See [http://www.env.go.jp/en/chemi/hs/minamata2002/ch2.html "Minamata Disease: The History and Measures, ch2"]&lt;/ref&gt; and over 10,000 had received financial compensation from Chisso.&lt;ref name=compensationnumbers&gt;See [http://www.nimd.go.jp/archives/english/index.html "Minamata Disease Archives"], Frequently asked questions, Question 6 &lt;!-- More recent figures required! --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004, Chisso Corporation had paid $86 million in compensation, and in the same year was ordered to clean up its contamination.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Hightower (2008). ''[[Diagnosis Mercury: Money, Politics and Poison]]'', Island Press, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 29, 2010, a settlement was reached to compensate as-yet uncertified victims.&lt;ref name="asahi.com"&gt;[http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201003300438.html "Agreement reached to settle Minamata suit"], ''Asahi Shimbun'' news, 31 March 2010, retrieved 1 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A second outbreak of Minamata disease occurred in [[Niigata Prefecture]] in 1965. The original Minamata disease and [[Niigata Minamata disease]] are considered two of the [[four big pollution diseases of Japan]].

== 1908–1955 ==
{{see also|Timeline of Minamata disease}}

The [[Chisso Corporation]] first opened a chemical factory in Minamata in 1908. Initially producing fertilisers, the factory followed the nationwide expansion of Japan's chemical industry, branching out into production of [[acetylene]], [[acetaldehyde]], [[acetic acid]], [[vinyl chloride]], and [[octanol]], among others. The Minamata factory became the most advanced in all of Japan, both before and after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Toxic Effects of Mercury|last=Nabi|first=Shabnum|date=2014|publisher=Springer, New Delhi|isbn=9788132219217|pages=187–199|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-81-322-1922-4_25|chapter = Methylmercury and Minamata Disease}}&lt;/ref&gt; The waste products resulting from the manufacture of these chemicals were released into Minamata Bay through the factory [[wastewater]]. These pollutants had an environmental impact. Fisheries were damaged in terms of reduced catches, and in response, Chisso reached two separate compensation agreements with the fishery cooperative in 1926 and 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Harada, p15&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapid expansion of the Minamata factory spurred on the local economy and as Chisso prospered, so did Minamata. This fact, combined with the lack of other industry, meant that Chisso had great influence in Minamata. At one point, over half of the tax revenue of Minamata City authority came from Chisso and its employees, and the company and its subsidiaries were responsible for creating a quarter of all jobs in Minamata.&lt;ref&gt;George, pp35-36&lt;/ref&gt; Minamata was even dubbed Chisso's "castle town", in reference to the capital cities of feudal lords who ruled Japan during the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref&gt;George, p26&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chisso Minamata factory first started [[acetaldehyde]] production in 1932, producing 210&amp;nbsp;tons that year. By 1951, production had jumped to 6,000&amp;nbsp;tons per year and reached a peak of 45,245 tons in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Social Scientific Study Group on Minamata Disease, ''[http://www.nimd.go.jp/syakai/webversion/SSSGMDreport.html In the Hope of Avoiding Repetition of a Tragedy of Minamata Disease]'', National Institute for Minamata Disease, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout, the Chisso factory's output amounted to between a quarter and a third of Japan's total acetaldehyde production. The [[chemical reaction]] used to produce the acetaldehyde used [[Mercury(II) sulfate|mercury sulfate]] as a catalyst. Starting August 1951, the co-catalyst was changed from manganese dioxide to ferric sulfide.&lt;ref&gt;Eto et al. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; A side reaction of this [[catalytic cycle]] led to the production of a small amount of an organic mercury compound, namely [[methylmercury]].&lt;ref&gt;For further information on the chemistry of the reaction that lead to the production of methylmercury see [http://www.hgtech.com/Information/Minamata_Japan.html "Information on Mercury"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711164401/http://www.hgtech.com/Information/Minamata_Japan.html |date=2011-07-11 }} by Mercury Technology Services, retrieved around the 24 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This highly toxic compound was released into Minamata Bay from the change of the co-catalyst in 1951 until 1968, when this production method was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;Gilhooly, Rob, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/06/13/national/history/mercury-rising-niigata-struggles-bury-minamata-ghosts/#.VXzeII0w85t Mercury rising: Niigata struggles to bury its Minamata ghosts]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 13 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1956–1959 ==

On April 21, 1956, a five-year-old girl was examined at the [[Chisso Corporation]]'s factory hospital in [[Minamata, Kumamoto]], a town on the west coast of the southern island of [[Kyūshū]]. The physicians were puzzled by her symptoms: difficulty walking, difficulty speaking, and [[convulsions]]. Two days later, her younger sister also began to exhibit the same symptoms and she, too, was hospitalised. The girls' mother informed doctors that her neighbour's daughter was also experiencing similar problems. After a house-to-house investigation, eight further patients were discovered and hospitalised. On May 1, the hospital director reported to the local public health office the discovery of an "[[epidemic]] of an unknown disease of the [[central nervous system]]", marking the official discovery of Minamata disease.&lt;ref&gt;Harada, p10&lt;/ref&gt;

To investigate the epidemic, the city government and various medical practitioners formed the {{nihongo|Strange Disease Countermeasures Committee|奇病対策委員会|Kibyō Taisaku Iinkai}} at the end of May 1956. Owing to the localised nature of the disease, it was suspected to be [[Infectious disease|contagious]] and as a precaution patients were isolated and their homes disinfected. Although contagion was later disproved, this initial response contributed to the [[Social stigma|stigmatisation]] and [[discrimination]] experienced by Minamata victims from the local community. During its investigations, the committee uncovered surprising anecdotal evidence of the strange behaviour of cats and other wildlife in the areas surrounding patients' homes. From around 1950 onward, cats had been seen to have convulsions, go mad, and die. Locals called it the {{nihongo|"cat dancing disease"|猫踊り病|neko odori byō}}, owing to their erratic movement.&lt;ref name="withrow" /&gt; Crows had fallen from the sky, seaweed no longer grew on the sea bed, and fish floated dead on the surface of the sea. As the extent of the outbreak was understood, the committee invited researchers from [[Kumamoto University]] to help in the research effort.&lt;ref&gt;Nicol, C.W., "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fe20121007cw.html Minamata: a saga of suffering and hope]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 7 October 2012, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kumamoto University Research Group was formed on August 24, 1956. Researchers from the School of Medicine began visiting Minamata regularly and admitted patients to the university hospital for detailed examinations. A more complete picture of the symptoms exhibited by patients was gradually uncovered. The disease developed without any prior warning, with patients complaining of a loss of sensation and numbness in their hands and feet. They became unable to grasp small objects or fasten buttons. They could not run or walk without stumbling, their voices changed in pitch, and many patients complained of difficulties seeing, hearing, and swallowing. In general, these symptoms deteriorated and were followed by severe convulsions, [[coma]], and eventually death. By October 1956, 40 patients had been discovered, 14 of whom had died, an alarming [[mortality rate]] of 35%.&lt;ref&gt;Harada, pp23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finding the cause ===

Researchers from Kumamoto University also began to focus on the cause of the strange disease. They found that the victims, often members of the same family, were clustered in fishing hamlets along the shore of Minamata Bay. The [[staple food]] of victims was invariably [[fish]] and [[shellfish]] from Minamata Bay. The cats in the local area, which tended to eat scraps from the family table, had died with symptoms similar to those now discovered in humans. This led the researchers to believe that the outbreak was caused by some kind of [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]], with contaminated fish and shellfish being the prime suspects.

On November 4, the research group announced its initial findings: "Minamata disease is rather considered to be poisoning by a heavy metal,  presumably it enters the human body mainly through fish and shellfish."&lt;ref&gt;Harada, pp26-27&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identification of mercury ===

|}

As soon as the investigation identified a [[Heavy metals|heavy metal]] as the causal substance, the wastewater from the Chisso plant was immediately suspected as the origin. The company's own tests revealed that its wastewater contained many heavy metals in concentrations sufficiently high to bring about serious environmental degradation, including [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[manganese]], [[arsenic]], [[thallium]], and [[copper]], plus the [[chalcogen]] [[selenium]]. Identifying which particular poison was responsible for the disease proved to be extremely difficult and time-consuming. During 1957 and 1958, many different theories were proposed by different researchers. At first, manganese was thought to be the causal substance due to the high concentrations found in fish and the [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] of the deceased. Thallium, selenium, and a multiple contaminant theory were also proposed, but in March 1958, visiting British [[neurologist]] [[Douglas McAlpine]] suggested that Minamata symptoms resembled those of [[Organic compound|organic]] [[mercury poisoning]], so the focus of the investigation centered on mercury.

In February 1959, the mercury distribution in Minamata Bay was investigated. The results shocked the researchers involved. Large quantities of mercury were detected in fish, shellfish, and [[sludge]] from the bay. The highest concentrations centred around the Chisso factory wastewater canal in [[Hyakken Harbour]] and decreased going out to sea, clearly identifying the plant as the source of contamination. Pollution was so heavy at the mouth of the wastewater canal, a figure of 2&amp;nbsp;kg of mercury per ton of sediment was measured: a level that would be economically viable to mine. Indeed, Chisso did later set up a subsidiary to reclaim and sell the mercury recovered from the sludge.&lt;ref name="Harada, p50"&gt;Harada, p50&lt;/ref&gt;

Hair samples were taken from the victims of the disease and also from the Minamata population in general. In patients, the maximum mercury level recorded was 705&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million]] (ppm), indicating very heavy exposure and in nonsymptomatic Minamata residents, the level was 191&amp;nbsp;ppm. This compared to an average level of 4&amp;nbsp;ppm for people living outside the Minamata area.&lt;ref name="Harada, p50"/&gt;

On November 12, 1959, the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health and Welfare]]'s Minamata Food Poisoning Subcommittee published its results:

{{quote|Minamata disease is a poisoning disease that affects mainly the central nervous system and is caused by the consumption of large quantities of fish and shellfish living in Minamata Bay and its surroundings, the major causative agent being some sort of organic mercury compound.&lt;ref&gt;Harada, p52&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== 1959 ==

[[Image:Minamata map illustrating Chisso factory effluent routes2.png|thumb|right|The Chisso factory and its wastewater routes]]

During the investigation by researchers at [[Kumamoto University]], the causal substance had been identified as a heavy metal and it was widely presumed that the Chisso plant was the source of the contamination. Chisso was coming under closer scrutiny and to deflect criticism, the wastewater output route was changed. Chisso knew of the environmental damage caused by its wastewater and was well aware that it was the prime suspect in the Minamata disease investigation. Despite this, from September 1958, instead of discharging its waste into Hyakken Harbour (the focus of investigation and source of original contamination), it discharged wastewater directly into Minamata River. The immediate effect was the death of fish at the mouth of the river, and from that point on, new Minamata disease victims began to appear in other fishing villages up and down the coast of the [[Shiranui Sea]], as the pollution spread over an even greater area.&lt;ref&gt;Harada, pp38-39&lt;/ref&gt;

Chisso failed to co-operate with the investigation team from Kumamoto University. It withheld information on its industrial processes, leaving researchers to speculate what products the factory was producing and by what methods.&lt;ref&gt;Ui, Chapter 4 – section IV&lt;/ref&gt; The Chisso factory's hospital director, [[Hajime Hosokawa]], established a laboratory in the research division of the plant to carry out his own experiments into Minamata disease in July 1959. Food to which factory wastewater had been added was fed to healthy cats. Seventy-eight days into the experiment, cat 400 exhibited symptoms of Minamata disease and [[pathological]] examinations confirmed a diagnosis of organic mercury poisoning. The company did not reveal these significant results to the investigators and ordered Hosokawa to stop his research.&lt;ref&gt;George, pp60-61&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to undermine Kumamoto University researchers' organic mercury theory, Chisso and other parties with a vested interest that the factory remain open (including the [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] and the [[Japan Chemical Industry Association]]) funded research into alternative causes of the disease, other than its own waste.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.soshisha.org/english/soshisha_e/stockholm_appeal.htm "The Stockholm Appeal"] by Soshisha – The Supporting Center for Minamata Disease, retrieved 08 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compensation of fishermen and patients, 1959 ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
{{Details|Minamata disease compensation agreements of 1959}}

Polluting wastewater had damaged the fisheries around Minamata ever since the opening of the Chisso factory in 1908. The Minamata Fishing Cooperative had managed to win small payments of {{nihongo|"sympathy money"|見舞い金|mimaikin}} from the company in 1926 and again in 1943, but after the outbreak of Minamata disease, the fishing situation was becoming critical. Fishing catches had declined by 91% between  1953 and 1957. The [[Kumamoto Prefecture|Kumamoto]] prefectural government issued a partial ban on the sale of fish caught in the heavily polluted Minamata Bay, but not an all-out ban, which would have legally obliged it to compensate the fishermen. The fishing cooperative protested against Chisso and angrily forced their way into the factory on 6 August and 12 August, demanding compensation. A committee was set up by Minamata Mayor [[Todomu Nakamura]] to mediate between the two sides, but this committee was stacked heavily in the company's favour. On 29 August, the fishing cooperative agreed to the mediation committee's proposal, stating: "In order to end the anxiety of the citizens, we swallow our tears and accept". The company paid the cooperative [[¥]]20 million (US$183,477) and set up a ¥15 million ($137,608) fund to promote the recovery of fishing.

[[Image:Minamata protesters.jpg|thumb|right|Protestors at the gates of the Chisso factory (''[[A. M. Smith]]'')]]

Since the change of route of wastewater output in 1958, pollution had spread up and down the Shiranui Sea, damaging fisheries there, too. Emboldened by the success of the small Minamata cooperative, the Kumamoto Prefectural Alliance of Fishing Cooperatives also decided to seek compensation from Chisso. On 17 October, 1,500 fishermen from the alliance descended on the factory to demand negotiations. When this produced no results, the alliance members took their campaign to [[Tokyo]], securing an official visit to Minamata by members of the Japanese [[Diet of Japan|Diet]]. During the visit on 2 November, alliance members forced their way into the factory and rioted, causing many injuries and ¥10 million ($100,000) worth of damage. The violence was covered widely in the media, bringing the nation's attention to the Minamata issue for the first time since the outbreak began. Another mediation committee was set up, and an agreement was hammered out and signed on 17 December. Some ¥25 million of "sympathy money" was paid to the alliance and a ¥65 million fishing recovery fund was established.

In 1959, the victims of Minamata disease were in a much weaker position than the fishermen. The recently formed Minamata Disease Patients Families Mutual Aid Society was much more divided than the fishing cooperatives. Patients' families were the victim of [[discrimination]] and [[ostracism]] from the local community. Local people felt that the company (and their city that depended upon it) was facing economic ruin. To some patients, this ostracism by the community represented a greater fear than the disease itself. After beginning a [[sit-in]] at the factory gates in November 1959, the patients asked [[Kumamoto Prefecture]] Governor [[Hirosaku Teramoto]] to include the patients' request for compensation with the mediation that was ongoing with the prefectural fishing alliance. Chisso agreed and after a few weeks' further negotiation, another "sympathy money" agreement was signed. Patients who were certified by a [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health and Welfare]] committee would be compensated: adult patients received ¥100,000 ($917) per year; children ¥30,000 ($275) per year, and families of dead patients would receive a one-off ¥320,000 ($2935) payment.

=== Wastewater treatment ===

On October 21, 1959, Chisso was ordered by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to switch back its wastewater drainage from the Minamata River to Hyakken Harbour and to speed up the installation of wastewater treatment systems at the factory. Chisso installed a [[Cyclator]] purification system on December 19, 1959, and opened it with a special ceremony. Chisso's president [[Kiichi Yoshioka]] drank a glass of water supposedly treated through the Cyclator to demonstrate that it was safe. In fact, the wastewater from the acetaldehyde plant, which the company knew still contained mercury and led to Minamata disease when fed to cats, was not treated through the Cyclator at the time. Testimony at a later [[Niigata Minamata disease]] trial proved that Chisso knew the Cyclator to be completely ineffective: "The purification tank was installed as a social solution and did nothing to remove organic mercury."&lt;ref&gt;Harada, p56&lt;/ref&gt;

The deception was successful and almost all parties involved in Minamata disease were duped into believing that the factory's wastewater had been made safe from December 1959 onward. This widespread assumption meant that doctors were not expecting new patients to appear, resulting in numerous problems in the years to follow, as the pollution continued. In most people's minds, the issue of Minamata disease had been resolved.

== 1959–1969 ==

The years between the first set of "sympathy money" agreements in 1959 and the start of the first legal action to be taken against Chisso in 1969 are often called the "ten years of silence". In fact, much activity on the part of the patients and fishermen took place during this period, but nothing had a significant impact on the actions of the company or the coverage of Minamata in the national media.

=== Continued pollution ===

Despite the almost universal assumption to the contrary, the wastewater treatment facilities installed in December 1959 had no effect on the level of organic mercury being released into the Shiranui Sea. The pollution and the disease it caused continued to spread. The Kumamoto and Kagoshima prefectural governments conducted a joint survey in late 1960 and early 1961 into the level of mercury in the hair of people living around the Shiranui Sea. The results confirmed that organic mercury had spread all around the inland sea and that people were still being poisoned by contaminated fish. Hundreds of people were discovered to have levels greater than 50 ppm of mercury in their hair, the level at which people are likely to experience nerve damage. The highest result recorded was that of a woman from [[Goshonoura, Kumamoto|Goshonoura]] island who had 920 ppm in her sample.

The prefectural governments did not publish the results and did nothing in response to these surveys. The participants who had donated hair samples were not informed of their result, even when they requested it. A follow-up study ten years later discovered that many had died from "unknown causes".&lt;ref&gt;George, pp144-145&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Congenital Minamata disease ===

Local doctors and medical officials had noticed for a long time an abnormally high frequency of [[cerebral palsy]] and other infantile disorders in the Minamata area. In 1961, a number of medical professionals including [[Masazumi Harada]] (later to receive an [[Global 500 Roll of Honour|honour from the United Nations]] for his body of work on Minamata disease) set about re-examining children diagnosed with cerebral palsy. The symptoms of the children closely mirrored those of adult Minamata disease patients, but many of their mothers did not exhibit symptoms. The fact that these children had been born after the initial outbreak and had never been fed contaminated fish also led their mothers to believe they were not victims. At the time the medical establishment believed the [[placenta]] would protect the &lt;!--This article is in Commonwealth English - please do not change foetus to fetus--&gt;[[foetus]] from toxins in the bloodstream, which is indeed the case with most chemicals. What was not known at the time was that exactly the opposite is the case with methylmercury: the placenta removes it from the mother's bloodstream and concentrates the chemical in the &lt;!--This article is in Commonwealth English - please do not change foetus to fetus--&gt;foetus.

After several years of study and the [[autopsies]] of two children, the doctors announced that these children were suffering from an as yet unrecognised [[congenital]] form of Minamata disease. The certification committee convened on 29 November 1962 and agreed that the two dead children and the 16 children still alive should be certified as patients, and therefore liable for "sympathy" payments from Chisso, in line with the 1959 agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Harada, pp68-77&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outbreak of Niigata Minamata disease ===
{{Details|Niigata Minamata disease}}

Minamata disease broke out again in 1965, this time along the banks of the [[Agano River]] in [[Niigata Prefecture]]. The polluting factory (owned by [[Showa Denko]]) employed a chemical process using a mercury catalyst very similar to that used by Chisso in Minamata. As in Minamata, from the autumn of 1964 to the spring of 1965, cats living along the banks of the Agano River had been seen to go mad and die. Before long, patients appeared with identical symptoms to patients living on the Shiranui Sea, and the outbreak was made public on 12 June 1965. Researchers from the Kumamoto University Research Group and [[Hajime Hosokawa]] (who had retired from Chisso in 1962) used their experience from Minamata and applied it to the Niigata outbreak. In September 1966, a report was issued proving Showa Denko's pollution to be the cause of this second Minamata disease.

Unlike the patients in Minamata, the victims of Showa Denko's pollution lived a considerable distance from the factory and had no particular link to the company. As a result, the local community was much more supportive of patients' groups and a lawsuit was filed against the company in March 1968, only three years after discovery.

The events in Niigata catalysed a change in response to the original Minamata incident. The scientific research carried out in Niigata forced a re-examination of that done in Minamata and the decision of Niigata patients to sue the polluting company allowed the same response to be considered in Minamata. Masazumi Harada has said that, "It may sound strange, but if this second Minamata disease had not broken out, the medical and social progress achieved by now in Kumamoto... would have been impossible."&lt;ref&gt;Harada, p90&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time, two other pollution-related diseases were also grabbing headlines in Japan. Victims of [[Yokkaichi Asthma|Yokkaichi asthma]] and [[Itai-itai disease]] were forming citizens' groups and filed lawsuits against the polluting companies in September 1967 and March 1968, respectively. As a group, these diseases came to be known as the [[four big pollution diseases of Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;George, pp174-175&lt;/ref&gt;

Slowly but surely, the mood in Minamata and Japan as a whole was shifting. Minamata patients found the public gradually becoming more receptive and sympathetic as the decade wore on. This culminated in 1968 with the establishment in Minamata of the Citizens' Council for Minamata Disease Countermeasures, which was to become the chief citizens' support group to the Minamata patients. A founding member of the citizens' council was [[Michiko Ishimure]], a local housewife and poet who later that year published {{nihongo|''Pure Land, Poisoned Sea: Our Minamata disease''|苦海浄土―わが水俣病|Kugai Jōdo: Waga Minamatabyō}} a book of poetic essays that received national acclaim.

== 1969–1973 ==

=== Official government recognition ===

Finally on 26 September 1968 – 12 years after the discovery of the disease (and four months after Chisso had stopped production of acetaldehyde using its mercury catalyst) – the government issued an official conclusion as to the cause of Minamata disease:

{{quote|Minamata disease is a disease of the central nervous system, a poisoning caused by long-term consumption, in large amounts, of fish and shellfish from Minamata Bay. The causative agent is methylmercury. Methylmercury produced in the acetaldehyde acetic acid facility of Shin Nihon Chisso's Minamata factory was discharged in factory wastewater... Minamata disease patients last appeared in 1960, and the outbreak has ended. This is presumed to be because consumption of fish and shellfish from Minamata Bay was banned in the fall of 1957, and the fact that the factory had waste-treatment facilities in place from January 1960.}}

The conclusion contained many factual errors: eating fish and shellfish from other areas of the Shiranui Sea, not just Minamata Bay, could cause the disease; eating small amounts, as well as large amounts of contaminated fish over a long time also produced symptoms; the outbreak had not, in fact, ended in 1960 nor had mercury-removing wastewater facilities been installed in January 1960. Nevertheless, the government announcement brought a feeling of relief to a great many victims and their families. Many felt vindicated in their long struggle to force Chisso to accept responsibility for causing the disease and expressed thanks that their plight had been recognised by their social superiors. The struggle now focused on to what extent the victims should be compensated.&lt;ref&gt;George, pp187-190&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Struggle for a new agreement ===

In light of the government announcement, the patients of the Mutual Aid Society decided to ask for a new compensation agreement with Chisso and submitted the demand on the 6th of October. The company replied that it was unable to judge what would be fair compensation and asked the national government to set up a binding arbitration committee to decide. This proposal split the members of the patients' society, many of whom were extremely wary of entrusting their fate to a third party, as they had done in 1959 with unfortunate results. At a meeting on the 5th of April 1969, the opposing views within the society could not be reconciled and the organisation split into the arbitration group (who were willing to accept binding arbitration) and the litigation group (who decided to sue the company). That summer, Chisso sent gifts to the families who opted for arbitration rather than litigation.

[[Image:Patients and family members hold photographs of their dead.jpg|thumb|right|Minamata patients and family members hold photographs of their dead during a demonstration (W. E. Smith)]]

An arbitration committee was duly set up by the Ministry of Health and Welfare on 25 April, but it took almost a year to draw up a draft compensation plan. A newspaper leak in March 1970 revealed that the committee would ask Chisso to pay only ¥2 million ($5,600) for dead patients and ¥140,000 to ¥200,000 ($390 to $560) per year to surviving patients. The arbitration group were dismayed by the sums on offer. They petitioned the committee, together with patients and supporters of the litigation group, for a fairer deal. The arbitration committee announced their compensation plan on 25 May in a disorderly session at the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Tokyo. Thirteen protesters were arrested. Instead of accepting the agreement as they had promised, the arbitration group asked for increases. The committee was forced to revise its plan and the patients waited inside the ministry building for two days while they did so. The final agreement was signed on 27 May. Payments for deaths ranged from ¥1.7 million to ¥4 million ($4,700 to $11,100), one-time payments from ¥1 million to ¥4.2 million ($2,760 to $11,660) and annual payments between ¥170,000 and ¥380,000 ($470 to $1,100) for surviving patients. On the day of the signing, the Minamata Citizens' Council held a protest outside the Minamata factory gates. One of the Chisso [[trade unions]] held an eight-hour strike in protest at the poor treatment of the arbitration group by their own company.&lt;ref name=arb&gt;George, pp191-202 (Arbitration Group)&lt;/ref&gt;

The litigation group, representing 41 certified patients (17 already deceased) in 28 families, submitted their suit against Chisso in the [[Kumamoto District Court]] on 14 June 1969. The leader of the group, [[Eizō Watanabe]] (a former leader of the Mutual Aid Society), declared, "Today, and from this day forth, we are fighting against the power of the state." Those who decided to sue the company came under fierce pressure to drop their lawsuits. One woman was visited personally by a Chisso executive and harassed by her neighbours. She was ignored, her family's fishing boat used without permission, their fishing nets were cut, and human faeces were thrown at her in the street.&lt;ref&gt;George, p205&lt;/ref&gt;

The litigation group and their lawyers were helped substantially by an informal national network of citizens' groups that had sprung up around the country in 1969. The {{nihongo|Associations to Indict [Those Responsible for] Minamata Disease|水俣病を告発する会|Minamata-byō o Kokuhatsu Suru Kai}} were instrumental in raising awareness and funds for the lawsuit. The Kumamoto branch, in particular, was especially helpful to the case. In September 1969, they set up a Trial Research Group, which included law professors, medical researchers (including [[Masazumi Harada]]), sociologists and even the housewife and poet Michiko Ishimure to provide useful material to the lawyers to improve their legal arguments. In fact, their report, ''Corporate Responsibility for Minamata Disease: Chisso's Illegal Acts'',&lt;ref&gt;{{nihongo|''Corporate Responsibility for Minamata Disease: Chisso's Illegal Acts''|水俣病に対する企業の責任：チッソの不法行為|Minamata-byō ni Tai Suru Kigyō no Sekinin: Chisso no Fuhō Kōi}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in August 1970, formed the basis of the ultimately successful lawsuit.&lt;ref name=arb/&gt;

The trial lasted almost four years. The litigation group lawyers sought to prove Chisso's [[Negligence|corporate negligence]]. Three main legal points had to be overcome to win the case. First, the lawyers had to show that methylmercury caused Minamata disease and that the company's factory was the source of pollution. The extensive research by Kumamoto University and the government conclusion meant that this point was proved quite easily. Second, could and should the company have anticipated the effect of its wastewater and should it have taken steps to prevent the tragedy (i.e., was the company negligent in its [[duty of care]])? Third, was the "sympathy money" agreement of 1959, which forbade the patients from claiming any further compensation, a legally binding contract?

The trial heard from patients and their families, but the most important testimony came from Chisso executives and employees. The most dramatic testimony came from Hajime Hosokawa, who spoke on 4 July 1970 from his hospital bed where he was dying of cancer. He explained his experiments with cats, including the infamous "cat 400", which developed Minamata disease after being fed factory wastewater. He also spoke of his opposition to the 1958 change in wastewater output route from Hyakken Harbour to Minamata River. His testimony was backed up by a colleague who also told how company officials had ordered them to halt their cat experiments in the autumn of 1959. Hajime Hosokawa died three months after giving his testimony. Former factory manager [[Eiichi Nishida]] admitted that the company put profits ahead of safety, resulting in dangerous working conditions and a lack of care with mercury. Former Chisso President [[Kiichi Yoshioka]] admitted that the company promoted a theory of dumped [[World War II]] explosives, though it knew it to be unfounded. 

The verdict handed down on 20 March 1973 represented a complete victory for the patients of the litigation group:

{{quote|The defendant's factory was a leading chemical plant with the most advanced technology and ... should have assured the safety of its wastewater. The defendant could have prevented the occurrence of Minamata disease or at least have kept it at a minimum. We cannot find that the defendant took any of the precautionary measures called for in this situation whatsoever. The presumption that the defendant had been negligent from beginning to end in discharging wastewater from its acetaldehyde plant is amply supported. The defendant cannot escape liability for negligence.}}

The "sympathy money" agreement was found to be invalid and Chisso was ordered to make one-time payments of ¥18 million ($66,000) for each deceased patient and from ¥16 million to ¥18 million ($59,000 to $66,000) for each surviving patient. The total compensation of ¥937 million ($3.4 million) was the largest sum ever awarded by a Japanese court.&lt;ref&gt;George, pp241-249&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uncertified patients' fight to be recognised ===

While the struggles of the arbitration and litigation groups against Chisso were continuing, a new group of Minamata disease sufferers emerged. To qualify for compensation under the 1959 agreement, patients had to be officially recognised by various ''ad hoc'' certification committees according to their symptoms. However, in an effort to limit the liability and financial burden on the company, these committees were sticking to a rigid interpretation of Minamata disease. They required that patients must exhibit all symptoms of [[Hunter-Russell syndrome]] – the standard diagnosis of organic mercury poisoning at the time – which originated from an industrial accident in the United Kingdom in 1940. The committee certified only patients exhibiting explicit symptoms of the British syndrome, rather than basing their diagnosis on the disease in Japan. This resulted in many applicants being rejected by the committee, leaving them confused and frustrated.&lt;ref&gt;Harada, pp156-157 and George, p208&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==

As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially certified (1,784 of whom have died)&lt;ref name=officialnumbers/&gt; and over 10,000 people had received financial compensation from Chisso,&lt;ref name=compensationnumbers/&gt; although they were not recognised as official victims. The issue of quantifying the impact of Minamata disease is complicated, as a full [[epidemiological study]] has never been conducted and patients were recognised only if they voluntarily applied to a certification council to seek financial compensation.&lt;ref name=Guardian1&gt;See [https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,574782,00.html "Mercury poisoning of thousands confirmed"] by Jonathan Watts, ''The Guardian'', 16 October 2001, retrieved 24 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kawamura|first=Hiroki|date=2017|title=The relation between law and technology in Japan: liability for technology-related mass damage in the cases of Minamata disease, asbestos, and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|journal=Contemporary Japan|volume=30 |issue=1|pages=3–27|doi=10.1080/18692729.2018.1423459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many victims of Minamata disease faced discrimination and ostracism from the local community if they came out into the open about their symptoms. Some people feared the disease to be contagious, and many local people were fiercely loyal to Chisso, depending on the company for their livelihoods. In this atmosphere, sufferers were reluctant to come forward and seek certification. Despite these factors, over 17,000 people have applied to the council for certification. Also, in recognising an applicant as a Minamata disease sufferer, the certification council qualified that patient to receive financial compensation from Chisso. For that reason, the council has always been under immense pressure to reject claimants and minimise the financial burden placed on Chisso. Rather than being a council of medical recognition, the decisions of the council were always affected by the economic and political factors surrounding Minamata and the Chisso corporation. Furthermore, compensation of the victims led to continued strife in the community, including unfounded accusations that some of the people who sought compensation did not actually suffer from the disease.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://soshisha.org/english/10tishiki_e/10chishiki_e.htm "Ten Things to Know about Minamata Disease"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725010737/http://soshisha.org/english/10tishiki_e/10chishiki_e.htm |date=2012-07-25 }} by Soshisha – The Supporting Center for Minamata Disease&lt;/ref&gt; More properly, the impact should be called a criminal 'poisoning', not a clinical 'disease'. These forms of obfuscation are commonly experienced by 'environmental victims' in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, C. (1998) Environmental Victims: New Risks new Injustice. London Earthscan.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Democratizing effects ==

According to [[Timothy S. George]], the environmental protests that surrounded the disease appeared to aid in the [[democratization]] of Japan.&lt;ref name=George&gt;George, Timothy S. (2001). ''Minamata: Pollution and the Struggle for Democracy in Postwar Japan''. Harvard University Asia Center. {{ISBN|0-674-00785-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When the first cases were reported and subsequently suppressed, the rights of the victims were not recognised, and they were given no compensation. Instead, the afflicted were ostracised from their community due to ignorance about the disease, as people were afraid that it was contagious.

The people directly impacted by the pollution of Minamata Bay were not originally allowed to participate in actions that would affect their future. Disease victims, fishing families, and company employees were excluded from the debate. Progress occurred when Minamata victims were finally allowed to come to a meeting to discuss the issue. As a result, postwar Japan took a small step toward democracy.

Through the evolution of public sentiments, the victims and environmental protesters were able to acquire standing and proceed more effectively in their cause. The involvement of the press also aided the process of democratization because it caused more people to become aware of the facts of Minamata disease and the pollution that caused it.

Although the environmental protests did result in Japan becoming more democratized, it did not completely rid Japan of the system that first suppressed the fishermen and victims of Minamata disease.

Toshiko Akiyoshi, touched by the plight of the fishing village, wrote a jazz suite, "Minamata" that was to be the central piece of the Toshiko Akiyoshi-Lew Tabackin Big Band's 1976 album on RCA, ''Insights'' .  The piece was constructed in three parts, to musically reflect the tragedy – "Peaceful Village", "Prosperity &amp; Consequence", and "Epilogue".  Akiyoshi used Japanese vocalists to sing the Japanese lyrics of a tone poem that were part of the composition.  The album won many awards in jazz circles, including ''Downbeat'''s best album award, largely on the strength of this piece, which brought some further attention on the tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;Record Review magazine vol 2 no 3 August 1978 – Scott Yanow; Downbeat (http://www.downbeat.com/default.asp?sect=stories&amp;subsect=story_detail&amp;sid=704); liner notes for Toshiko Akiyoshi/Lew Tabackin Big Band LP, Insights 1976 RCA VICTOR   AFL1-2678  STEREO&lt;/ref&gt; [[Insights (Toshiko Akiyoshi – Lew Tabackin Big Band)]]

The song "Kepone Factory" on [[Dead Kennedys]]' ''[[In God We Trust, Inc.]]'' makes reference to the disaster in its chorus.

The song "The Disease of the Dancing Cats" by the band [[Bush (band)|Bush]] on "The Science of Things" album is in reference to the disaster.

=== Media ===
Photographic documentation of Minamata started in the early 1960s. One photographer who arrived in 1960 was [[Shisei Kuwabara]], straight from university and photo school, who had his photographs published in ''[[Weekly Asahi]]'' as early as May 1960. The first exhibition of his photographs of Minamata was held in the [[Fujifilm|Fuji]] Photo Salon in Tokyo in 1962, and the first of his book-length anthologies, ''Minamata Disease'', was published in Japan in 1965. He has returned to Minamata many times since.&lt;ref name="kmopa"&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20011223130736/http://www.kmopa.com/minamata/minamata.htm Shisei Kuwabara – 'Minamata': The Starting point of the work of the photojournalist, Shisei Kuwabara]", KMoPA. (In Japanese, despite the English title.) Accessed 4 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a dramatic photographic essay by [[W. Eugene Smith]] brought world attention to Minamata disease. His Japanese wife and he lived in Minamata from 1971 to 1973. The most famous and striking photo of the essay, ''[[Tomoko Uemura in Her Bath]]'' (1972) shows Ryoko Uemura, holding her severely deformed daughter, Tomoko, in a Japanese bath chamber. Tomoko was poisoned by methylmercury while still in the womb. The photo was very widely published. It was posed by Smith with the co-operation of Ryoko and Tomoko to dramatically illustrate the consequences of the disease. It has subsequently been withdrawn from circulation at the request of Tomoko's family, so does not appear in recent anthologies of Smith's works.&lt;ref name=Tomoko&gt;Read the thoughts of a photography magazine editor surrounding the controversy of the photograph's withdrawal: [http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue0007/hughes.htm "Tomoko Uemura, R.I.P."] by Jim Hughes, ''The Digital Journalist,'' retrieved 24 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith and his wife were extremely dedicated to the cause of the victims of Minamata disease, closely documenting their struggle for recognition and right to compensation. Smith was himself attacked and seriously injured by Chisso employees in an incident in Goi, [[Ichihara, Chiba|Ichihara]] city, near Tokyo on January 7, 1972, in an attempt to stop the photographer from further revealing the issue to the world.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp94-95&lt;/ref&gt; The 54-year-old Smith survived the attack, but his sight in one eye deteriorated and his health never fully recovered before his death in 1978.&lt;!-- Well, no, it didn't; but while I don't want to whitewash the disgusting actions of Chissos' goons, plenty of other factors  hastened Smith's death.  Also sung about in the Dead Kennedys song Kepone Factory. --&gt;

Japanese photographer Takeshi Ishikawa, who assisted Smith in Minamata, has since exhibited his own photographs documenting the disease.  His photographs cover the years 1971 to the present, with Minamata victims as his subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Hirano, Keiji, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20121115f1.html Life with Minamata disease in photos]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 15 November 2012, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The prominent Japanese [[documentary film]]maker [[Noriaki Tsuchimoto]] made a series of films, starting with ''[[Minamata: The Victims and Their World]]'' (1971) and including ''[[The Shiranui Sea]]'' (1975), documenting the incident and siding with the victims in their struggle against Chisso and the government.

Minamata disease remains an important issue in contemporary Japanese society. [[Lawsuits]] against Chisso and the prefectural and national governments are still continuing and many regard the government responses to date as inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ed20061003a1.html "Minamata's latest chapter"], ''Japan Times'' editorial, 3 October 2006, retrieved 29 October 2006 (free registration required)&lt;/ref&gt; The company's "historical overview" in its current website makes no mention of their role in the mass contamination of Minamata and the dreadful aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chisso Corporation|title=Historical Overview|url=http://www.chisso.co.jp/english/company/time_line.html|work=Chisso Corporation official site|publisher=Chisso|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their 2004 Annual Report however reports an equivalent of about US$50 million (5,820 million yen) in "Minamata Disease Compensation Liabilities".  From 2000 to 2003, the company also reported total compensation liabilities of over US$170 million. Their 2000 accounts also show that the [[Government of Japan|Japanese]] and [[Kumamoto Prefecture|Kumamoto prefectural]] governments waived an enormous US$560 million in related liabilities. Their FY2004 and FY2005 reports refer to Minamata disease as "[[Mad hatter disease|mad hatter's disease]]", a term coined from the mercury poisoning experienced by hat-makers of the last few centuries (cf. [[Erethism]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chisso.co.jp/english/investors/other/80th_e.pdf FY2004] and [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100809113011/http%3A//www.chisso.co.jp/english/investors/other/81th_e.pdf FY2005] financial results. URL retrieved 2008-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

A memorial service was held at the Minamata Disease Municipal Museum on 1 May 2006 to mark 50 years since the official discovery of the disease. Despite bad weather, the service was attended by over 600 people, including Chisso chairman [[Shunkichi Goto]] and [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Environment Minister]] [[Yuriko Koike]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20060502a1.html "Memorial service marks Minamata tragedy's 50th year"], ''Japan Times'', 2 May 2006, retrieved 29 October 2006 (free registration required)&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday, March 29, 2010, a group of 2,123 uncertified victims reached a settlement with the government of Japan, the Kumamoto Prefectural government, and Chisso Corporation to receive individual lump-sum payments of 2.1 million yen and monthly medical allowances.&lt;ref name="asahi.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hirano, Keiji, [[Kyodo News]], "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120301f1.html Mercury pact falls short on Minamata]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 1 March 2012, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most congenital patients are now in their forties and fifties and their health is deteriorating. Their parents, who are often their only source of care, are into their seventies or eighties or already deceased. Often these patients find themselves tied to their own homes and the care of their family, effectively isolated from the local community. Some welfare facilities for patients do exist. One notable example is &lt;!--PLEASE NOTE that Hot House uses the hiragana form ほっとはうす in Japanese. Please do not change it to katakana.--&gt;{{nihongo|'''Hot House'''|ほっとはうす|Hotto Hausu}}, a vocational training centre for congenital patients as well as other disabled people in the Minamata area. Hot House members are also involved in raising awareness of Minamata disease, often attending conferences and seminars as well as making regular visits to elementary schools throughout [[Kumamoto Prefecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200605100178.html "Advanced welfare should arise from Minamata"] by Takeko Kato, ''Asahi Shimbun'', 10 May 2006, retrieved 29 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ongoing Research on methylmercury toxicity: Minamata disease ==
Currently, several research groups are working on methylmercury toxicity. Scientific community trying to decipher the in-depth molecular mechanism of the disease caused due to methylmercury. The critical target of this compound is central nervous system. Various labs across the world are looking for the cure also. Scientists are testing natural products against methylmercury induced toxicity. Recently, Kalaivani et al., found an essential oil extracted from selinum vaginatum exerts neuroprotection against CH&lt;small&gt;3&lt;/small&gt;Hg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pjps.pk/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/31/2/Paper-7.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The plant comprises seven separate [[boiling water reactor]]s originally designed by [[General Electric]] (GE), and maintained by the [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]] (TEPCO). At the time of the quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold [[shutdown (nuclear reactor)|shutdown]] for planned maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author =Black, Richard |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12745186 |title= Reactor breach worsens prospects |work=BBC Online |date=15 March 2011 |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1-3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. However the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed. The flooded generators failed, cutting power to the critical pumps that must continuously circulate [[Nuclear_reactor_coolant#Water|coolant water]] through a [[generation II reactor|Generation II nuclear reactor]] for several days in order to keep it from melting down after being shut down. As the pumps stopped, the [[Decay heat#Power reactors in shutdown|reactors overheated]] due to the normal high radioactive [[decay heat]] produced in the first few days after nuclear reactor shutdown (smaller amounts of this heat normally continue to be released for years, but are not enough to cause fuel melting).  

At this point, only prompt flooding of the reactors with seawater could have cooled the reactors quickly enough to prevent meltdown.  Salt water flooding was delayed because it would ruin the costly reactors permanently.  Flooding with seawater was finally commenced only after the government ordered that seawater be used, and at this point it was too late to prevent meltdown.&lt;ref&gt;F. Tanabe, Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology, 2011, volume 48, issue 8, pages 1135 to 1139&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the water boiled away in the reactors and the water levels in the [[Spent nuclear fuel|fuel]] rod pools dropped, the reactor fuel rods began to overheat severely, and to melt down.  In the hours and days that followed, Reactors 1, 2 and 3 experienced full [[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/06/06/japan.nuclear.meltdown/index.html?iref=NS1 |title=3 nuclear reactors melted down after quake, Japan confirms |work=CNN|date= 7 June 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T110607005367.htm |title='Melt-through' at Fukushima? / Govt report to IAEA suggests situation worse than meltdown |work=Yomiuri |date=8 June 2011 |accessdate=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. As workers struggled to cool and shut down the reactors, several [[Hydrogen safety|hydrogen-air]] chemical explosions occurred.&lt;ref name="IAEA15March"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyer.eu/news/regional-news/hydrogen-in-nuclear-accidents-what-is-the-role-of-the-gas-in-fukushima Hydrogen explosions Fukushima nuclear plant: what happened?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235552/http://www.hyer.eu/news/regional-news/hydrogen-in-nuclear-accidents-what-is-the-role-of-the-gas-in-fukushima |date=2 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Concerns about the repeated small explosions, the atmospheric venting of radioactive gasses, and the possibility of larger explosions led to a {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}}-radius evacuation around the plant. During the early days of the accident workers were temporarily evacuated at various times for [[radiation]] safety reasons. At the same time, sea water that had been exposed to the melting rods was returned to the sea heated and radioactive in large volumes for several months until recirculating units could be put in place to repeatedly cool and re-use a limited quantity of water for cooling.  The earthquake damage and flooding in the wake of the tsunami hindered external assistance.  Electrical power was slowly restored for some of the reactors, allowing for automated cooling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704021504576210251376606080 Stricken reactors may get power Sunday], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 19 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==
Japanese officials initially assessed the accident as Level 4 on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]] (INES) despite the views of other international agencies that it should be higher. The level was later raised to 5 and eventually to 7, the maximum scale value.&lt;ref&gt;Justin McCurry.

==Radioactivity released==

==Accident rating==

[[File:Fukushima7.png|thumb|Comparison of radiation levels for different nuclear events.]]

The severity of the nuclear accident is provisionally&lt;ref name="en20110412-4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nisa.meti.go.jp/english/files/en20110412-4.pdf |title=NISA News Release April&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2011 |format=PDF |accessdate=24 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xsyUr2Wx?url=http://www.nisa.meti.go.jp/english/files/en20110412-4.pdf |archivedate=12 April 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; rated 7 on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]] (INES). This scale runs from 0, indicating an abnormal situation with no safety consequences, to 7, indicating an accident causing widespread contamination with serious health and environmental effects. Prior to Fukushima, the [[Chernobyl disaster]] was the only level 7 accident on record, while the [[Three Mile Island accident]] was a level 5 accident. [[Arnold Gundersen]], an engineer frequently commissioned by anti-nuclear groups, said that "Fukushima is the biggest industrial catastrophe in the history of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.alternet.org/story/151440/fukushima%3A_world%27s_worst_industrial_disaster_reveals_how_nation_states_are_powerless_to_protect_us_from_advanced_technology | title = Fukushima: World's worst industrial disaster reveals how nation states are powerless to protect us from advanced technology | last = Kotsev | first=Victor | publisher =[[AlterNet]] | date = 27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/06/201161664828302638.html | title=Fukushima: It's much worse than you think | publisher=[[Aljazeera]] | date=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, current estimates of the total amount of radioactivity released from the 3 Fukushima Daiichi reactors is only 10-20% that from Chernobyl.&lt;ref name="iaeaf120411" /&gt; 

The [[Japan Atomic Energy Agency]] initially rated the Unit 1 situation as below both of these previous accidents; on 13 March it announced it was classifying the event as Level 4, an "accident with local consequences".&lt;ref name=autogenerated14&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/12/us-japan-quake-rating-idUSTRE72B2FR20110312|title=Japan rates quake less serious than Three Mile Island, Chernobyl|author =Maeda, Risa|date=12 March 2011|work=Reuters |accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 March it raised its rating on Units 1, 2 and 3 to Level 5, an "accident with wider consequences".

Several parties disputed the Japanese classifications, arguing that the situation was more severe than they were admitting at the time. On 14 March, three Russian experts stated that the nuclear accident should be classified at Level 5, perhaps even Level 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author =Shuster, Simon|title=Fire at Fourth Reactor: Is Worse Yet to Come in the Fukushima Nuclear Disaster?|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2059232,00.html|work=Time Magazine|date=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One day later, the [[Autorité de sûreté nucléaire|French nuclear safety authority]] and the [[Säteilyturvakeskus|Finnish nuclear safety authority]] said that the Fukushima plant could be classified as a Level 6.&lt;ref name=french-level6&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/15/japan-quake-nuclear-france-idUSLDE72E2M920110315 |title=UPDATE 1-French nuclear agency now rates Japan accident at 6 |work=Reuters |date=15 March 2011|accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="finnish"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hs.fi/ulkomaat/artikkeli/STUK+Fukushiman+turman+vakavuus+jo+kuutosluokkaa/1135264592277 |title=STUK: Fukushiman turman vakavuus jo kuutosluokkaa |work=Helsingin Sanomat|date=15 March 2011|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 March, a scientific consultant for anti-nuclear environmental group [[Greenpeace]], working with data from the Austrian [[Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics|ZAMG]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zamg.ac.at/docs/aktuell/Japan2011-03-22_1500_E.pdf |title=...Spread of Radioactivity/first source estimates from CTBTO data... |work=ZAMG|date=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and French [[Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire|IRSN]], prepared an analysis in which he rated the total Fukushima accident at INES level 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.greenpeace.de/fileadmin/gpd/user_upload/themen/atomkraft/INES_7march_25th.pdf | title= Fukushima Already Level 7 Chernobyl Accident: Greenpeace analysis concludes| publisher=Greenpeace | date=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fukushima Dosis qtl1 en.svg|thumb|left|Radiation dose rates during the initial hydrogen explosions.]]

The ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' newspaper reported on 26 March that the accident might warrant Level 6, based on its calculations.&lt;ref name="japanlevel6"&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201103250204.html |title=Radiation from Fukushima exceeds Three Mile Island |work=Asahi Shimbun |place=Japan |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Wall Street Journal'' stated that Japan's NISA would make any decision on raising the level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2011/03/25/at-a-glance-crisis-rating-white-smoke-at-plant-death-toll-tops-10000/ |title=At a Glance: Crisis Rating, Worker Injuries, Death Toll Tops 10,000 |date=25 March 2011 |accessdate=25 March 2011 |work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; INES Level 6, or "serious accident", had only been applied to the [[Kyshtym disaster]] (Soviet Union, 1957), while the only level 7 was [[Chernobyl]] (Soviet Union, 1986). Previous Level 5 accidents included the [[Windscale fire]] (United Kingdom, 1957), the [[Lucens reactor]] (Switzerland, 1969), [[Three Mile Island accident]] (United States, 1979), and the [[Goiânia accident]] (Brazil, 1987).

Assessing "seriousness" as partial or full meltdown at a civilian plant, ''The New York Times'' reported on 3 April that based on remote sensing, computer "simulations suggest that the number of serious accidents has suddenly doubled, with three of the reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi complex in some stage of meltdown." The ''Times'' counted three previous civilian meltdowns, from [[World Nuclear Association]] information: Three Mile Island, [[Saint-Laurent Nuclear Power Plant]] (France, 1980, INES level 4), and Chernobyl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/03/science/03meltdown.html|title = From Afar, a Vivid Picture of Japan Crisis|author = William J. Broad|date=2 April 2011|work = The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 April, the Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) temporarily raised the disaster at Fukushima Daiichi to Level 7 on the INES scale, by considering the whole event and not considering each reactor as an individual event (each rated between 3 and 5). This would make Fukushima the second Level 7 "major accident" in the history of the nuclear industry; however, radioactivity released as a result of the events at Fukushima was, as of 12 April, only approximately 10% of that released as a result of the accident at [[Chernobyl]] (1986), also rated as INES Level 7.&lt;ref name="en20110412-4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iaeaf120411"&gt;{{cite web|author =Austria |url=http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/2011/fukushima120411.html |title=IAEA Fukushima Nuclear Accident Update Log – Updates of 12&amp;nbsp;April&amp;nbsp;2011 |work=Iaea.org |date=12 April 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 21 October 2011, the largest study on Fukushima fallout concludes that Fukushima was "the largest radioactive noble gas release in history not related to nuclear bomb testing.

Hot spots are being found 60 to 70 kilometres away from the reactor (further away than they were found from Chernobyl), and the amount of radiation in many of them is the amount that caused areas to be declared no-man's-land for Chernobyl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Aljazeera]]|title=Fukushima: It's much worse than you think|author = Dahr Jamail |date=16 June 2011| url = http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/06/201161664828302638.html}}{{POV-statement|Gunderson|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In off-the-record-interviews with Japanese newspapers like the ''Tokyo Shimbun'', former Japanese prime minister [[Naoto Kan]] said that there were moments he believed the disaster could have surpassed Chernobyl, many times. At first TEPCO denied that fuel-cores were melted, after all cooling functions were lost. Trade minister Banri Kaieda mentioned that TEPCO seriously considered pulling away all staff members from the plant and leaving it abandoned. Kan could not accept this: "Withdrawing from the plant is out of the question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = In Nuclear Crisis, Crippling Mistrust | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/13/world/asia/13japan.html?pagewanted=all | date = 12 June 2011 | accessdate = 20 September 2012 | first=Norimitsu | last = Onishi | first2= Martin | last2= Fackler | publisher = [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He claimed that "If that had happened, Tokyo would be deserted by now. It was a critical moment for Japan's survival. It could have been a led to leaks of dozens of times more radiation than Chernobyl."&lt;ref name=PMFeared&gt;{{cite news | title = Fukushima nuclear disaster: PM at the time feared Japan would collapse | first=Justin | last=McCurry

TEPCO's president at that time, Masataka Shimizu, was never clear in his answers, and TEPCO failed to obey the orders to vent one of the overheating reactors. In an interview to the ''Asahi Shimbun'' newspaper, Kan revealed that he went to the plant itself and visually inspected it from above in a helicopter because: "I felt I had to go there in person and speak to the people in charge or I would never have known what was going on."&lt;ref name=PMFeared/&gt; Kan said that the American government was seriously concerned about the Japanese response to the accident: "We were not told straight out, but it was obvious that they questioned whether we were really taking this seriously."&lt;ref name=PMFeared/&gt;

Kan defended his changed attitude to a non-nuclear energy policy, "If there is a risk of accidents that could make half the land mass of our country uninhabitable, then we cannot afford to take that risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher =[[The Guardian]] | date =8 September 2011 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/08/fukushima-nuclear-disaster-pm-japan | title= Tepco had considered abandoning the plant after it was hit by the 11 March tsunami | location=London | first=Justin | last=McCurry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| '''Cause of the accident''' || The plants were not designed with consideration of such a large [[tsunami]]. A major [[2011 Tohoku earthquake|earthquake and tsunami]] caused the destruction of power lines and backup generators. Once the plants were without external power and the generators were flooded, a catastrophic [[decay heat]] casualty ensued, leading to major reactor plant damage including [[nuclear meltdown|meltdown]]s and explosive loss of [[reactor containment]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} || Proximate cause was human error and violation of procedures. The unsafe reactor design caused instability at low power due to a positive [[void coefficient]] and steam formation. When an improper test was conducted at 1:00 am at low power, the reactor became [[prompt critical]]. This was followed by a [[steam explosion]] that exposed the fuel, a raging fire, and a [[core meltdown]]. The fire lasted for days to weeks, and there is controversy over whether it was the fuel burning, nuclear decay heating or whether the [[graphite]] moderator that made up most of the core was involved.  See [[Chernobyl Disaster]], Note 1, for more discussion.

[[Fukushima disaster cleanup]] is ongoing. || All reactors were shut down by 2000. The damaged reactor was covered by a hastily built steel and concrete structure called the ''[[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus|sarcophagus]]''. A [[New Safe Confinement]] structure was installed in November 2016, from which the plant will be cleaned up and decommissioned.

'''Fukushima 50''' is the [[pseudonym]] given by the media to a group of employees at the crippled [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]]. Following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] on 11 March 2011, a related [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|series of nuclear accidents]] resulted in melting of the cores of three reactors.

During some work, in high radiation areas, the workers were limited to 15-minute sessions inside the damaged buildings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/03/31/japans-nuclear-rescuers-inevitable-die-weeks/ Japan's Nuclear Rescuers: 'Inevitable Some of Them May Die Within Weeks'&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radiation===
The international limit for radiation exposure for nuclear workers is 20 [[Sievert|millisievert]] (20&amp;nbsp;mSv, or 2 rem) per year, averaged over five years, with a limit of 50&amp;nbsp;mSv in any one year, however for workers performing emergency services [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) guidance on dose limits is 100&amp;nbsp;mSv when "protecting valuable property" and 250&amp;nbsp;mSv when the activity is "life saving or protection of large populations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/rpdweb00/docs/er/400-r-92-001.pdf Table 2-2] [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the accident, the maximum permissible dose for Japanese nuclear workers was 100&amp;nbsp;mSv in any one year, but on 15 March 2011, the Japanese Health and Labor Ministry enforced the permitted 250&amp;nbsp;mSv limit, in light of the situation at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/16/world/asia/16workers.html |department=Asia |date=16 March 2011 |title=Last Defense at Troubled Reactors: 50 Japanese Workers |first1=Keith |last1=Bradsher |first2=Hiroko |last2=Tabuchi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = NHK | place = JP | url = http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/16_19.html | title = Gov't ups permissible radiation level | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110317010034/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/16_19.html | archivedate = 17 March 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the workers at Fukushima plant declined the elevated 250&amp;nbsp;mSv limit and kept adopting the previous 100&amp;nbsp;mSv.&lt;ref name=mainichi250Declined&gt;{{cite news|title=TEPCO tries to enclose high radiation in sea in nuke crisis|url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110410p2g00m0dm011000c.html|accessdate=10 April 2011|newspaper=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|date=10 April 2011|location=JP|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410215931/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110410p2g00m0dm011000c.html#|archive-date=10 April 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tokyo Enesys, a TEPCO's subsidiary, adopts 80&amp;nbsp;mSv to manage the radiation level monitoring with some buffer.

==Explosions==

The Fukushima 50 were present when hydrogen explosions occurred at the reactor buildings of units 1, 3, and 4. Five workers were injured in the unit 1 explosion at 15:36 on 12 March. Most of the injuries were not severe. Eleven workers were injured in the unit 3 explosion at 11:01 on 14 March. The explosion at unit 4 at about 6am on 15 March did not cause injuries. The explosions scattered radioactive concrete debris around the buildings, which made the working conditions on the site more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasegawa|first=A.|last2=Ohira|first2=T.|last3=Maeda|first3=M.|last4=Yasumura|first4=S.|last5=Tanigawa|first5=K.|date=2016-04-01|title=Emergency Responses and Health Consequences after the Fukushima Accident; Evacuation and Relocation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0936655516000054|journal=Clinical Oncology|language=en|volume=28|issue=4|pages=237–244|doi=10.1016/j.clon.2016.01.002|issn=0936-6555|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cas.go.jp/jp/seisaku/icanps/eng/120224Honbun02Eng.pdf|title=Interim report|last=|first=|date=26 December 2011|website=|publisher=Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations|pages=51-52|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Number of workers==

[[File:TFD-LP.jpg|thumb|right|Water tower vehicles from major fire departments were integral to the emergency cooling operations]]

Originally there were approximately 800 workers on 11 March 2011, the day the earthquake and tsunami struck. On 15 March, workers deemed non-essential were withdrawn by the [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]].  A total of around 750 workers left due to increased risk and consequently left around 50. It was on this day that the media started to call the remaining workers the "Fukushima 50".

However, on the morning of the 16 March the remaining workers had to be evacuated for a brief period of time due to a radiation spike which was detected which could be harmful to the workers' health. It was reported that when they returned to the plant, a further 130 or so workers joined their colleagues to total of around 180 to stabilize the reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Winerman|first=Lea|title=The 'Fukushima 50': Nuclear Workers Stay Behind to Brave Plant's Woes|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2011/03/nuclear-plant-workers-become-anonymous-faces-of-bravery.html|accessdate=16 March 2011|newspaper=PBS NewsHour}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of workers rose to 580 on the morning of the 18 March.&lt;ref name=Asahi /&gt; By 12 April, approximately 700 workers were working on-site.&lt;ref name="asahi.com"&gt;http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201104110137.html Heroes and realists found among the brave "Fukushima 700"&lt;/ref&gt;

By 21 March 2011, Toshiba had sent a 100-strong team to two Fukushima plants as part of a task-force of 700 Toshiba workers organized at Toshiba's [[Isogo-ku, Yokohama|Isogo]] Engineering Centre to defuse the nuclear crisis, and Hitachi had dispatched 120 to Fukushima I and formed a 1000-strong task force.&lt;ref name=Reuters110322&gt;

Referring to the original 50 workers, nuclear researcher Dr. Eric Hall opined that they were likely to be older, and unlikely to have further children, so the long-term effects of exposure to high-levels of [[ionizing radiation]] would be less likely to appear before a [[Death by natural causes|natural death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/fukushima-50-line-defense-japanese-nuclear-complex/story?id=13147746&amp;page=2 |title=Japan's Fukushima 50: Heroes Who Volunteered to Stay Behind at Japan's Crippled Nuclear Plants

According to Robert Hetkämper, a correspondent for the German television network [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]], the label "Fukushima 50" was invented by a foreign newspaper, and then was imported by the Japanese media. The "Fukushima 50" would include engineers as well as unskilled workers, and there would be grounds to suspect that many workers were not really aware of the dangers of their assignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=ARD|title=Die "Fukushima 50" sind eine Legende|trans-title=The "Fukushima 50" are a legend|language=German|location=GER|date=23 March 2011|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/japanberichterstattung100.html|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chernobyl did not."&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant comprises six separate [[boiling water reactor]]s originally designed by [[General Electric]] (GE), and maintained by the [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]] (TEPCO). At the time of the quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold [[shutdown (nuclear reactor)|shutdown]] for planned maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Black, Richard |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12745186 |title=Reactor breach worsens prospects |work=BBC Online |date=15 March 2011 |accessdate=23 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xDYTkU7P?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12745186 |archivedate=16 March 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1-3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. However, the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed. The flooded generators failed, cutting power to the critical pumps that must continuously circulate [[Nuclear reactor coolant#Water|coolant water]] through a nuclear reactor for several days in order to keep it from melting down after being shut down. As the pumps stopped, the [[Decay heat#Power reactors in shutdown|reactors overheated]] due to the normal high radioactive [[decay heat]] produced in the first few days after nuclear reactor shutdown (smaller amounts of this heat normally continue to be released for years, but are not enough to cause fuel melting).

At this point, only prompt flooding of the reactors with seawater could have cooled the reactors quickly enough to prevent meltdown. Salt water flooding was delayed because it would ruin the costly reactors permanently. Flooding with seawater was finally commenced only after the government ordered that seawater be used, and at this point it was already too late to prevent meltdown.&lt;ref&gt;F. Tanabe, Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology, 2011, volume 48, issue 8, pages 1135 to 1139&lt;/ref&gt;

As the water boiled away in the reactors and the water levels in the [[Spent nuclear fuel|fuel]] rod pools dropped, the reactor fuel rods began to overheat severely, and to melt down. In the hours and days that followed, Reactors 1, 2 and 3 experienced full [[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/06/06/japan.nuclear.meltdown/index.html?iref=NS1 |title=3 nuclear reactors melted down after quake, Japan confirms |work=CNN|date= 7 June 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140414115531/http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/06/06/japan.nuclear.meltdown/index.html?iref=NS1 | archivedate = 2014-04-14| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T110607005367.htm |title='Melt-through' at Fukushima? / Govt report to IAEA suggests situation worse than meltdown |work=Yomiuri |date=8 June 2011 |accessdate=8 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zSkWxIIC?url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T110607005367.htm |archivedate=15 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. As workers struggled to cool and shut down the reactors, several [[hydrogen explosion|hydrogen-air]] chemical explosions occurred.&lt;ref name="IAEA15March"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyer.eu/news/regional-news/hydrogen-in-nuclear-accidents-what-is-the-role-of-the-gas-in-fukushima Hydrogen explosions Fukushima nuclear plant: what happened?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235552/http://www.hyer.eu/news/regional-news/hydrogen-in-nuclear-accidents-what-is-the-role-of-the-gas-in-fukushima |date=2 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns about the repeated small explosions, the atmospheric venting of radioactive gasses, and the possibility of larger explosions led to a {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}}-radius evacuation around the plant. During the early days of the accident workers were temporarily evacuated at various times for [[radiation]] safety reasons. At the same time, sea water that had been exposed to the melting rods was returned to the sea heated and radioactive in large volumes for several months until recirculating units could be put in place to repeatedly cool and re-use a limited quantity of water for cooling. The earthquake damage and flooding in the wake of the tsunami hindered external assistance. Electrical power was slowly restored for some of the reactors, allowing for automated cooling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704021504576210251376606080 Stricken reactors may get power Sunday], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 19 March 2011 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510123846/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704021504576210251376606080.html |date=10 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese officials initially assessed the accident as Level 4 on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]] (INES) despite the views of other international agencies that it should be higher. The level was later raised to 5 and eventually to 7, the maximum scale value.&lt;ref&gt;Justin McCurry.

To cool the reactor, operators resorted to the plant's Emergency core-cooling systems (ECCS), including the [[isolation condenser]]s, and the [[High Pressure Coolant Injection]] systems (HPCI). According to [[NHK]], the isolation condenser system had not been activated in the previous 40 years, and no one present had ever witnessed its operation.&lt;ref&gt;''Meltdown Oversights in the Reactor Cooling System'', NHK World (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; It was also later discovered that TEPCO had made changes to the system's original design, without approval or notification of NISA. During the crisis, operators couldn't tell if one of the system's valves was open or closed.&lt;ref name="mainichi1"&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (28 February 2012){{Cite web |url=http://www.houseofjapan.com/local/tepco-ordered-to-report-on-change-in-piping-layout-at-fukushima-plant |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 November 2018 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130629114449/http://www.houseofjapan.com/local/tepco-ordered-to-report-on-change-in-piping-layout-at-fukushima-plant# |archive-date=29 June 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 10 minutes after the earthquake, TEPCO operators removed both of Unit 1's isolation condensers from service, and instead activated the HPCI system. At 15:07, the core spray system was activated to cool the suppression pool. Both systems lost power after the tsunami struck the plant.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The tsunami's arrival prevented operators from restarting the isolation condensers for more than 30 minutes. Afterwards, they were operated intermittently. Despite being designed to cool Unit 1 for at least 8 hours, the condensers' limited operation did not reduce the heat in the core and containment vessel.

By midnight, water levels in the reactor were falling and TEPCO gave warnings of the possibility of radioactive releases.&lt;ref name="TEPCO12-3:00"/&gt; In the early hours of 12 March, TEPCO reported that radiation levels were rising in the turbine building for Unit 1.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720010409/http://e.nikkei.com/e/fr/tnks/Nni20110311D11JF351.htm Radiation level rising in Fukushima Nuclear Plant turbine building.] Nikkei.com. 12 March 2011 JST.

===Hydrogen explosion===
At 07:00 JST on 12 March, Prime Minister Naoto Kan asked Daiichi director [[Masao Yoshida (nuclear engineer)|Masao Yoshida]] why his workers were not opening the valves to release rising steam pressure within the reactor. Yoshida answered that they could not open the electrical valves because of the power failure and the radiation was too high to send workers to manually open the valves. Nevertheless, with the pressure and temperatures continuing to rise, at 09:15, TEPCO sent workers to begin manually opening the valves. The high radiation slowed the work and the valves were not opened until 14:30.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida, Reiji, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110607a3.html Probe poised to take Tepco to task]", ''Japan Times'', 7 June 2011, p. 1. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 15:36 JST on 12 March, there was an explosion in the reactor building at Unit 1. The side walls of the upper level were blown away, leaving in place only the vertical steel framed gridworks. The roof collapsed, covering the floor and some machinery on the south side. The walls were relatively intact compared to later explosions at Units 3 and 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:福島第１原発で爆発と白煙　４人ケガ|url=http://www.news24.jp/articles/2011/03/12/06178055.html|work=Nippon Television Network Corporation|accessdate=12 March 2011|language=Japanese| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130714031352/http://www.news24.jp/articles/2011/03/12/06178055.html | archivedate = 2013-07-14| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/11031234-e.html|title=TEPCO press release 34|work=Tepco|date=12 March 2011| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130317234851/http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/11031234-e.html | archivedate = 2013-03-17| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video of the explosion shows that it was primarily directed sideways.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3_ZRO5oATk&amp;NR=1 Fukushima (Japan) Nuclear Power Plant Explosion 12 March 2011 - YouTube] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321033158/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3_ZRO5oATk&amp;NR=1 |date=21 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The roof of the building was designed to provide ordinary weather protection for the areas inside, not to withstand the high pressure of an explosion. In the Fukushima I reactors the primary containment consists of "drywell" and "wetwell" concrete structures below the top level, immediately surrounding the reactor pressure vessel. The secondary containment includes the top floor with water-filled pools for storing fresh or irradiated fuel and for storage of irradiated tools and structures.&lt;ref name=WNN1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthingsnuclear.org/post/3824043948/update-on-fukushima-reactor |work=allthingsnuclear.org |title=Drawing of the reactor and explanation of the containments |accessdate=13 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xA5UxurO?url=http://allthingsnuclear.org/post/3824043948/update-on-fukushima-reactor |archivedate=13 March 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 24 March, the spent fuel pool was "thought to be fully or partially exposed", according to CNN.&lt;ref name="cnn-status-0324"/&gt; Pressure in the reactor had increased owing to the seawater injection, resulting in steam being vented, later alleviated by reducing the water flow. Temperature increases were also reportedly temporary. TEPCO condensed some of the steam to water in the spent fuel pool.

It was estimated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forandagainst.com/Fear_Of_Fukushima_s_Reactors_Cooling_Systems_Clogging_Up_With_Salt |title=Fear Of Fukushima's Reactors Cooling Systems Clogging Up With Salt |work=Forandagainst.com |date=24 March 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2011| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120315235504/http://www.forandagainst.com/Fear_Of_Fukushima_s_Reactors_Cooling_Systems_Clogging_Up_With_Salt | archivedate = 2012-03-15| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; that as much as 26 tonnes of sea salt may have accumulated in reactor Unit 1 and twice that amount in Units 2 and 3. As salt clogs cooling pipes and erodes zirconium oxide layer of the fuel rods, switching to the use of freshwater for cooling was a high priority.

The use of seawater has the potential to make uranium chemistry more complex; in pure water the [[hydrogen peroxide]] formed by the radiolysis of water can react with uranium dioxide to form a solid peroxide mineral known as [[studtite]]. According to Navrotsky ''et al.'' this mineral has been found in the fuel storage pond at the plutonium production site at [[Hanford Site|Hanford]]. Navrotsky ''et al.'' report that when alkali metal ions are present, uranium can form nanoparticles (U&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; clusters) which may be more mobile than the solid studtite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Armstrong | first1 = C.R. | last2 = Nyman | first2 = M. | last3 = Shvareva | first3 = T. | last4 = Sigmon | first4 = G.E. | last5 = Burns | first5 = P.C. | last6 = Navrotsky | first6 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Uranyl peroxide enhanced nuclear fuel corrosion in seawater| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = | pages = 1874–1877 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1119758109 | pmid=22308442 | pmc=3277545}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of the research done at the University of Notre Dame on the subject of nanoscale actinyl clusters was published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burns | first1 = Peter C. | year = 2010 | title = From extended solids to nano-scale actinide clusters| url = | journal = Comptes Rendus Chimie | volume = 13 | issue = 6–7| pages = 737–746 | doi=10.1016/j.crci.2010.01.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 and 26 April, concerns that Unit 1 fuel rods may be exposed to air caused TEPCO to consider filling the "containment vessel with water to cool the reactor" despite concerns for building integrity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090529082420/http://www.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/26_31.html TEPCO to fill No.1 reactor with water], NHK, 26 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110522223434/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/23_05.html Reactor 1 water level concerns], NHK, 23 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts were slowed by Unit 1 radiation measurements "as high as 1,120 millisierverts of radiation per hour".&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-27/tokyo-water-radiation-falls-to-zero-for-first-time-since-crisis.html Radiation Readings in Fukushima Reactor Rise to Highest Since Crisis Began], Bloomberg, 27 April 2011 {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5yG6JyTQO?url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-27/tokyo-water-radiation-falls-to-zero-for-first-time-since-crisis.html |date=27 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 May, TEPCO announced it would proceed with a plan to fill the containment vessel despite the possibility of holes caused by melting fuel elements in the pressure vessel.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/12/us-japan-nuclear-reactor-idUSTRE74B1H520110512 Fukushima reactor has a hole, leading to leakage], Reuters, 12 May 2011 {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5yd1SrWvn?url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/12/us-japan-nuclear-reactor-idUSTRE74B1H520110512 |date=12 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; TEPCO had expected to increase the amount of water pumped to Unit 1 to compensate for any leakage from the holes&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110519022809/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/13_03.html No.1 reactor is in a "meltdown" state], NHK, 13 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; but decided on 15 May to abandon the plan after finding the Unit 1 basement was already half flooded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13404548 Japan nuclear: Tepco halts Fukushima cooling plan], BBC, 15 May 2011. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601023125/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13404548 |date=1 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 May, ventilation systems were installed in the Reactor Building, to clean the highly radioactive air encapsulated in it.&lt;ref name=7746P/&gt;

On 12 May, the water level gauge for the reactor was calibrated, and it was subsequently identified that the water level was lower than previously thought (as the water level went off the lower side of the gauge).&lt;ref name=7746P/&gt;

On 13 May, preparatory work started on the installation of the Reactor Building covers. Construction work started on 28 June.&lt;ref name="110819e2"/&gt;

Since 2 July, the reactor has been cooled using fresh water from the on-site water treatment plant.&lt;ref name=110819e2/&gt;

On 21 August, TEPCO reported that all of the temperature sensors of Unit 1 were recording temperatures less than 100 degrees Celsius on Friday 19 August. Once other goals are met, Unit 1 will have achieved cold shutdown state.&lt;ref name="576P"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1313897576P.pdf |title= Earthquake Report number 180 |work= JAIF |accessdate= 22 August 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111011132608/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1313897576P.pdf |archivedate= 11 October 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports of 13 observations of neutron beams 1.5&amp;nbsp;km "southwest of the plant's No. 1 and 2 reactors" from 13 to 16 March raised the possibility that [[nuclear chain reaction]]s could have occurred after the initial SCRAMing of the reactors at Fukushima Daiichi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2011/03/80539.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521182726/http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2011/03/80539.html|archivedate=2011-05-21|title=Neutron beam observed 13 times at crippled Fukushima nuke plant |agency=Kyodo News |accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 16 March reports that fuel rods in the spent fuel pool at Unit 4 could have been exposed to air appeared to indicate that uncontrolled fission may have occurred in that fuel pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Black, Richard |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12762608 |title=Surprise 'critical' warning raises nuclear fears |work=BBC Online |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=7 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xEcKoBfU?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12762608 |archivedate=16 March 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later reports of exceptionally high [[iodine-134]] levels appeared to confirm this theory because very high levels of iodine-134 would be indicative of criticality.&lt;ref name="boston.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2011/03/28/elevated_radiation_levels_force_plant_evacuation/ |title=Elevated radiation levels force plant evacuation |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |accessdate=12 April 2011 |first1=Hiroko |last1=Tabuchi |first2=Keith |last2=Bradsher |date=28 March 2011| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131101054756/http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2011/03/28/elevated_radiation_levels_force_plant_evacuation/ | archivedate = 2013-11-01| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same report also showed high measurements of [[chlorine-38]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nisa.meti.go.jp/english/files/en20110325-6.pdf |title=NISA News Release |format=PDF |accessdate=7 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y2c0NOwW?url=http://www.nisa.meti.go.jp/english/files/en20110325-6.pdf |archivedate=18 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; which some nuclear experts used to calculate that self-propagating fission must be occurring in Unit 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Harrell, Eben |url=http://ecocentric.blogs.time.com/2011/03/30/has-fukushimas-reactor-no-1-gone-critical/ |title=Has Fukushima's Reactor No. 1 Gone Critical? |work=Time |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=7 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xbIPhI5I?url=http://ecocentric.blogs.time.com/2011/03/30/has-fukushimas-reactor-no-1-gone-critical/ |archivedate=31 March 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lewis.armscontrolwonk.com/files/2011/03/Cause_of_the_high_Cl38_Radioactivity.pdf |title=What was the cause of the high Cl-38 radioactivity in the Fukushima Daiichi Reactor #11 |format=PDF |accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite TEPCO suggesting the iodine-134 report was inaccurate, the IAEA appeared to accept the chlorine-based analysis as a valid theory suggesting criticality when it stated at a press conference that "melted fuel in the No. 1 reactor building may be causing isolated, uncontrolled nuclear chain reactions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tirone, Jonathan |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-30/record-high-levels-of-radiation-found-in-sea-near-crippled-nuclear-reactor.html |title=Japan weighs entombing nuclear plant in bid to halt radiation |work=Bloomberg |accessdate=7 April 2011 |date=31 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xbBONlfA?url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-30/record-high-levels-of-radiation-found-in-sea-near-crippled-nuclear-reactor.html |archivedate=31 March 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; TEPCO confirmed its concern about the accuracy of the high iodine and chlorine report by formally retracting the report on 21 April,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Inajima, Tsuyoshi |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-21/tepco-retracts-chlorine-arsenic-findings-at-fukushima-station.html |title=Tepco Retracts Chlorine, Arsenic Findings at Fukushima Station |work=Bloomberg |date=20 April 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2011| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140407041117/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-21/tepco-retracts-chlorine-arsenic-findings-at-fukushima-station.html | archivedate = 2014-04-07| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which eliminated both the exceptionally high iodine-134 and chlorine-38 levels as proof of criticality.

===Meltdown===
On 12 May, TEPCO engineers confirmed that a meltdown occurred, with molten fuel having fallen to the bottom of the reactor's pressure vessel, or RPV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/8509502/Nuclear-meltdown-at-Fukushima-plant.html |title=Nuclear meltdown at Fukushima plant |date=12 May 2011 |author=Julian Ryall |work=The Daily Telegraph |place=London |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ydGfSyub?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/8509502/Nuclear-meltdown-at-Fukushima-plant.html |archivedate=12 May 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The utility said that fuel rods of the No. 1 reactor are fully exposed, with the water level 1&amp;nbsp;meter (3.3&amp;nbsp;feet) below the base of the fuel assembly. According to a Japanese press report, there are holes in the base of the pressure vessel – these holes were meant for the control-rods. After the fuel had melted, it produced holes in the bottom of the RPV, and then escaped into the containment vessel. In November 2011 TEPCO did not know the shape or porosity of the fuel mass, which is at the bottom of the containment vessel.&lt;ref&gt;TEPCO (30-11-2012)[http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/nu/fukushima-np/images/handouts_111130_04-e.pdf Handout 30 November 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it is impossible to know exactly how far the fuel mass would have eroded the concrete floor, but TEPCO estimate that no more than 70&amp;nbsp;cm of a 7.6&amp;nbsp;meter concrete slab was eroded away by the hot fuel. The production of heat and steam in unit 1 has decreased, as suggested by both radioactive decay calculations and photographic evidence (same source from TEPCO).

TEPCO estimates the nuclear fuel was exposed to the air less than five hours after the earthquake struck. Fuel rods melted away rapidly as the temperature inside the core reached 2,800&amp;nbsp;°C within six hours. In less than 16&amp;nbsp;hours, the reactor core melted&lt;ref name="Reactor core melted"/&gt; and dropped to the bottom of the pressure vessel, burning a hole through the vessel. By that time, water was pumped into the reactor in an effort to prevent the worst-case scenario – overheating fuel melting its way through the containment and discharging large amounts of radionuclides in the environment.&lt;ref name="WSJCoresDamaged"/&gt; In June the Japanese government confirmed that Unit 1 reactor vessel containment was breached, and pumped cooling water continues to leak months after the disaster.&lt;ref name="ktvz.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktvz.com/news/28143212/detail.html |title=Japan: 3 nuclear reactors melted down – News Story – KTVZ Bend |work=Ktvz.com |date=6 June 2011 |accessdate=13 July 2011| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120627071525/http://www.ktvz.com/news/28143212/detail.html | archivedate = 2012-06-27| deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 October 2012, TEPCO released results of the first direct inspections (by remotely operated camera) of conditions in the interior of the Reactor 1 PCV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201210110078 Ashai Shimbun (11/10/2012)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309040356/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201210110078 |date=9 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These suggest that the initial assumptions concerning the behaviour of the fuel mass during the accident may have been incorrect. In particular, the distribution of radiation levels within the PCV, with peak levels being around the bottom head of the RPV, suggest that the majority of the fuel has in fact been retained within the RPV. Radiation levels are also notably lower around the lower parts of the "Drywell", suggesting that fuel had not reached the bottom of the containment vessel, or damaged the concrete floor slab. There is a further issue in that radiation levels within the water inside the containment are markedly higher than those in the reactor basements, suggesting that either there is limited flow from the PCV to the basement, or that substantial dilution is taking place - raising the issue of what is the flow path for the water.

===Spent fuel pool of reactor 1===
From 31 March, additional sea water was added to the spent fuel pool, initially by using a concrete pump. Fresh water was used from 14 May. By 29 May water was able to be injected using a temporary pump and the Spent Fuel Pool Cooling (FPC) line.&lt;ref name=7746P/&gt;&lt;ref name=110819e2/&gt;

On 10 August, the spent fuel pool was switched from the water-injection system – that functioned some 5 months – to a circulatory cooling system. For the first time since the 11 March disaster, all four damaged reactors at the plant were using circulatory cooling systems with heat-exchangers.&lt;ref&gt;''Jaif'' (11 August 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1313037997P.pdf Circulatory cooling begins at No.1 reactor pool] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/60vpoDAu2?url=http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1313037997P.pdf |date=14 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==

===March 11, 2011 event===
The plant comprises six separate [[boiling water reactor]]s originally designed by [[General Electric]] (GE), and maintained by the [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]] (TEPCO). At the time of the quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold [[shutdown (nuclear reactor)|shutdown]] for planned maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Black, Richard |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12745186 |title= Reactor breach worsens prospects |work=BBC Online |date=15 March 2011 |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1-3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. A tsunami following the earthquake flooded the low-lying rooms where emergency generators were housed. The flooded generators failed, cutting power to the critical pumps that circulate [[Nuclear reactor coolant#Water|coolant water]] to keep them from melting down. When the pumps stopped, the [[Decay heat#Power reactors in shutdown|reactors overheated]] due to the high radioactive [[decay heat]] produced in the first few days after nuclear reactor shutdown. As the water boiled away in the reactors and the water levels in the [[Spent nuclear fuel|fuel]] rod pools dropped, the reactor fuel rods began to overheat severely. In the hours and days that followed, Reactors 1, 2 and 3 experienced full [[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/06/06/japan.nuclear.meltdown/index.html?iref=NS1 |title=3 nuclear reactors melted down after quake, Japan confirms |work=CNN|date= 7 June 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T110607005367.htm |title='Melt-through' at Fukushima? / Govt report to IAEA suggests situation worse than meltdown |work=Yomiuri |date=8 June 2011 |accessdate=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to halt a meltdown, the government ordered that seawater be used to cool the reactors, as no alternative was available at the time. Because of the delay in this process, meltdown progressed, depositing most of the melted fuel at the bottom of the reactor vessel.&lt;ref&gt;F. Tanabe, Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology, 2011, volume 48, issue 8, pages 1135 to 1139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bulk of melted fuel in No. 2 reactor at damaged Fukushima plant at bottom of pressure vessel: Tepco|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/07/28/national/bulk-melted-fuel-bottom-fukushima-no-2-reactor-vessel-tepco/#.WJZWe3e-KIY|accessdate=4 February 2017|publisher=The Japan Times|date=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Starr|first1=Steven|title=Costs and Consequences of the Fukushima Daiichi Disaster|url=http://www.psr.org/environment-and-health/environmental-health-policy-institute/responses/costs-and-consequences-of-fukushima.html|website=Environmental Health Policy Institute|publisher=Physicians for Social Responsibility|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heat and pressure of the melting reactors, caused a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water producing explosive hydrogen gas. As workers struggled to cool and shut down the reactors, several [[hydrogen explosion|hydrogen-air]] chemical explosions occurred.&lt;ref name="IAEA15March"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyer.eu/news/regional-news/hydrogen-in-nuclear-accidents-what-is-the-role-of-the-gas-in-fukushima Hydrogen explosions Fukushima nuclear plant: what happened?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235552/http://www.hyer.eu/news/regional-news/hydrogen-in-nuclear-accidents-what-is-the-role-of-the-gas-in-fukushima |date=2 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about the repeated small explosions, the atmospheric venting of radioactive gasses, and the possibility of larger explosions led to a {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}}-radius evacuation around the plant. During the early days of the accident workers were temporarily evacuated at various times for [[radiation]] safety reasons. At the same time, sea water that had been exposed to the melting rods was returned to the sea heated and radioactive in large volumes for several months until recirculating units could be put in place to repeatedly cool and re-use a limited quantity of water for cooling. The earthquake damage and flooding in the wake of the tsunami hindered external assistance. Electrical power was slowly restored for some of the reactors, allowing for automated cooling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704021504576210251376606080 Stricken reactors may get power Sunday], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 19 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese officials initially assessed the accident as Level 4 on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]] (INES) despite the views of other international agencies that it should be higher. The level was later raised to 5 and eventually to 7, the maximum scale value.&lt;ref&gt;Justin McCurry.

Unit 2 was operating at the time of the earthquake and experienced the same controlled initial shutdown as the other units.&lt;ref name=WNN1/&gt; As with unit 1, the reactor scrammed following the earthquake. The two diesel generators came online and initially all cooling systems were available. Initially the high pressure coolant injection (HPCI) system was primary cooling the core and at 15:00 operators activated the residual heat removal system main pump and the containment vessel spray pump at 15:07 to cool the suppression pool; all these systems failed following both AC power and DC power loss after the tsunami as the diesel generators and other systems failed when the tsunami overran the plant. The reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) system was manually activated by operators at 15:39 following power loss, but by midnight the status of the reactor was unclear; some monitoring equipment was still operating on temporary power.&lt;ref name="TEPCO12-3:00"/&gt; The coolant level was stable and preparations were underway to reduce pressure in the reactor containment vessel should it become necessary, though TEPCO did not state in press releases what these preparations were, and the government had been advised that this might happen.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; The RCIC was reported by TEPCO to have shut down around 19:00 JST on 12 March, but reported to be operating again as of 09:00 JST 13 March.&lt;ref name="TEPCO12-3:20"/&gt; The pressure reduction of the reactor containment vessel commenced before midnight on 12 March&lt;ref name="TEPCO13-3:00"/&gt; although the IAEA reported that as of 13:15 JST 14 March, that according to information supplied to them, no venting had taken place at the plant.&lt;ref name=IAEAtsunami1/&gt; A report in ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that plant officials initially concentrated efforts on a damaged fuel storage pool at Unit 2, diverting attention from problems arising at the other reactors, but that incident was not reported in official press releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=In stricken fuel-cooling pools, a danger for the longer Term|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/world/asia/15fuel.html |work=The New York Times|accessdate=14 March 2011|first1=William J.|last1=Broad|first2=Hiroko|last2=Tabuchi|date=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IAEA reported that on 14 March at 09:30, the RCIC was still operating and that power was being provided by a mobile generator.&lt;ref name=IAEAtsunami1/&gt;

===Cooling problems===
On 14 March, TEPCO reported the shutdown of the RCIC system presumably due to low reactor pressure. Operators had for days taken measures to prevent the reactor pressure from dropping below the level at which the RCIC can operate to keep it running as long as possible. The system was never designed to be used for an extended period.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt; [[Nuclear fuel|Fuel rods]] had been fully exposed for 140 minutes and there was a risk of a core meltdown.&lt;ref name=kyodonews59&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2011/03/77959.html |title=Crisis continues at Fukushima nuclear plant as fuel rods exposed again |agency=Kyodo News |accessdate=23 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320225038/http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2011/03/77959.html |archivedate=20 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reactor water level indicators were reported to be showing minimum-possible values at 19:30 JST on 14 March.&lt;ref name="NISA23"/&gt;

At 22:29 JST, workers had succeeded in refilling half the reactor with water but parts of the rods were still exposed, and technicians could not rule out the possibility that some had melted. It was hoped that holes blown in the walls of reactor building 2 by the earlier blast from Unit 3 would allow the escape of hydrogen vented from the reactor and prevent a similar explosion.&lt;ref name=kyodonews59/&gt; At 21:37 JST, the measured dose rates at the gate of the plant reached a maximum of 3.13 [[Milli-|m]][[sievert|Sv]]/h, which was enough to reach the annual limit for non-nuclear workers in twenty minutes,&lt;ref name=kyodonews59/&gt; but had fallen back to 0.326 mSv/h by 22:35.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-03-14/tepco-fears-fuel-rods-melt-fights-to-stabilize-stricken-reactor.html |title=Tepco Fears Fuel Rods Melt, Fights to Stabilize Stricken Reactor |work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |date=14 March 2011 |accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was believed that around 23:00 JST, the 4 m long fuel rods in the reactor were fully exposed for the second time.&lt;ref name=kyodonews59/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-03/14/c_13778395.htm|title=Fuel rods fully exposed again at Fukushima nuclear power plant|date=14 March 2011|work=Xinhuanet}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 00:30 JST on 15 March, NHK ran a live press conference with TEPCO stating that the water level had sunk under the rods once again and pressure in the vessel was raised. The utility said that the hydrogen explosion at Unit 3 might have caused a glitch in the cooling system of Unit 2: Four out of five water pumps being used to cool the Unit 2 reactor had failed after the explosion at Unit 3. In addition, the last pump had briefly stopped working when its fuel ran out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Vastag, Brian |url=

The unit's air flow gauge was accidentally turned off and, with the gauge turned off, flow of water into the reactor was blocked leading to full exposure of the rods.

At Thursday 23 June Tepco-workers entered the building of reactor 2, to install a provisional gauge for measuring the water level inside the reactor. The original device was damaged in March. Next Saturday 25 June Tepco reported, that it was still not possible to obtain accurate data on the water level and pressure of this reactor. The temperature near the containment vessel is very high, because of this the gauge did not function properly: the water inside the tubes of the gauge was evaporated.&lt;ref&gt;''NHK-World'' (25 June 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/25_08.html TEPCO unable to gauge No.2 reactor water level] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230060058/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/25_08.html# |date=30 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was later revealed that workers were minutes from restoring power to the standby liquid control (SLC) system pumps in unit 2 as a way to inject borated water once the RCIC shut down and had spent hours laying cable from a generator truck to the unit 2 power center when the unit 1 explosion occurred. This damaged the cable preventing this method from being used. It is possible this system could have prevented a complete meltdown as it took hours after the explosion until injection using fire trucks could be started.&lt;ref&gt;''TEPCO'' (10 August 2011) [http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/betu11_e/images/110810e21.pdf Chronology of Events at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November workers did enter reactor-building no. 4, and inspected the place to determine the cause of the hydrogen-blast on 15 March 2011. They found the 5th floor more severely damaged compared with the 4th floor, where the spent fuel pool was located. The fuel itself was found undamaged. The workers also found a severely damaged air conditioning duct on floor 5. These findings did not support earlier assumptions that the hydrogen in the blast originated from the spent fuel pool of reactor 4, but instead proved that the explosion was caused by hydrogen from the number 3 reactor, after the valves were opened. The hydrogen reached the fifth floor of reactor building 4 through the aforementioned damaged air conditioning duct.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (10 November 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/10_26.html TEPCO: hydrogen from reactor caused blast] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327200226/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/10_26.html# |date=27 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (11 November 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1320979544P.pdf Earthquake-report 262] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516170840/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1320979544P.pdf |date=16 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 March, TEPCO reported measurements of very high radiation levels, over 1000 mSv/h, in the basement of the Unit 2 turbine building, which officials reported was 10 million times higher than what would be found in the water of a normally functioning reactor.

===Seawater used for cooling===
At 20:05 JST on 14 March, the Japanese government ordered [[seawater]] to be injected into Unit 2 in a new effort to cool the reactor core. The treatment had been held as a last resort since it ruins the reactor. TEPCO started seawater cooling at 16:34.&lt;ref name=7746P/&gt; From 26 March, freshwater was used to cool the core.&lt;ref name=110819e2/&gt;

===Reactor stabilization===
By 26 March 2011, electrical power (initially from temporary sources, off-site power starting 3 April) was restored to parts of the Unit, with the Main Control Room lighting being restored.&lt;ref name=110819e2/&gt;

On 28 March, the Nuclear Safety Commission announced its suspicion that radioactive materials had leaked from Unit 2 into water in trenches connecting Unit 2's buildings, leading TEPCO to reduce the amount of water pumped into the reactor because of fears that the water could leak into the sea.&lt;ref name="a10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/29_05.html |title=TEPCO faces challenge in cooling reactor |work=.nhk.or.jp |date=29 March 2011 |accessdate=7 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428220505/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/29_05.html |archivedate=28 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction in water pumping could have raised reactor temperatures.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"/&gt;

On 27 March, the IAEA reported temperatures at the bottom of the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) at Unit 2 fell to 97&amp;nbsp;°C (206.6&amp;nbsp;°F) from 100&amp;nbsp;°C (212&amp;nbsp;°F) on Saturday. Operators attempted to pump water from the turbine hall basement to the condenser,&lt;ref name="a11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a2007"/&gt; but "both condensers turned out to be full."&lt;ref name="a4"/&gt; Therefore, condenser water was first attempted to be pumped to storage tanks, freeing condenser storage for water currently in the basement of Unit 2.&lt;ref name="a4"/&gt; The pumps now being used can move 10 to 25 tons of water per hour.&lt;ref name="a4"/&gt; On 19 April 2011, TEPCO began transferring excess radioactive cooling water from the reactor's basement and maintenance tunnels to a waste processing facility.&lt;ref&gt;''[[NHK]]'', "Transfer of highly contaminated water begins", 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 April, remote control robot was used to enter the Reactor Building and performed a series of inspections.&lt;ref name=7746P/&gt;

On 18 May, staff entered the Reactor Building for the first time since 15 March.&lt;ref name=110819e2/&gt;

On 11 June, ventilation systems were installed in the Reactor Building, to clean the highly radioactive air encapsulated within the Reactor Building.&lt;ref name=110819e2/&gt;

On 28 June, TEPCO began injecting nitrogen into the containment vessel, which was expected to reduce the likelihood of further hydrogen explosions.&lt;ref name=110819e2/&gt;

Since 2 July, the Reactor has been cooled using fresh water treated by the on site water treatment plant.&lt;ref name=110819e2/&gt;

On 14 September at 11AM (JST) TEPCO began injecting water into the No. 2 reactor using the core spray system piping in addition to the feed water piping already being used as this method seemed to be effective in reducing the temperature in the No. 3 reactor. At that time the temperature at the bottom of the No. 2 reactor was still 114.4 degrees Celsius (237.92&amp;nbsp;°F), compared to the 84.9&amp;nbsp;°C degrees(184.82&amp;nbsp;°F) in the No.1 reactor and the 101.3&amp;nbsp;°C (214.34&amp;nbsp;°F) in the No. 3 reactor. The new method has led to some temperature decrease, but not as significant as the decrease that occurred in the No.3 reactor.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (15 September 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1316055932P.pdf Earthquake report 205: TEPCO spraying water directly into No.2 reactor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616194029/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1316055932P.pdf |date=16 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After some positive effect was noticed using both the core spray system and feed water piping, TEPCO decided on 16 September to increase the amount of water pumped into the No. 2 reactor by one ton, in an attempt to further lower the temperature in the core, to a total of 7 tons per hour. The same was done for reactor No. 3, where 5 tons were added, bring the total to 12 tons per hour. TEPCO also added that the volume of cooling water into the No. 1 reactor would be increased as necessary.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (16 September 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1316230575P.pdf Earthquake report 207: TEPCO injects more water in two reactors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419005542/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1316230575P.pdf |date=19 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 September 2011, Masanori Naitoh, director in charge of nuclear safety analysis at the Institute of Applied Energy, an expert commenting on the plan to contain the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, mentioned that the interior temperatures of the damaged reactors had to be checked to confirm cold-shutdown. Naitoh said that TEPCO was only measuring temperatures outside the reactors, and that the temperatures inside should be confirmed through simulation to confirm that they had fallen below 100 degrees, and that there were no risks of [[Nuclear chain reaction|nuclear reactions]] recurring.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (21 September 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1316660947P.pdf Earthquake-report 212: Expert urges checks of reactor interiors] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419005612/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1316660947P.pdf# |date=19 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first week of February 2012, temperatures inside reactor No. 2 became unstable. On 7 February, the amount of cooling water was increased from 10.5 tons to 13.5 tons per hour. After a slight initial decrease in temperature, sensor readings again showed the temperature rising at some locations in the bottom of the reactor. On 11 February, temperatures rose once again.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (NHK-world)(11 February 2012) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1329022645P.pdf Earthquake-report 345: Temperature inside No.2 reactor rises again]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily news( 8 February 2012) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120208p2g00m0dm023000c.html Fukushima No. 2 reactor cools slightly after increased water injection] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210223659/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120208p2g00m0dm023000c.html# |date=10 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (8 February 2012) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/20120208_26.html Temperature decreasing inside Fukushima reactor]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (7 February 2012) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1328604911P.pdf Earthquake report 340]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 February, the temperature rose to 78.3&amp;nbsp;°C (172.94&amp;nbsp;°F). TEPCO denied the possibility of the core going critical again, because that would produce [[xenon]], which was still below detectable levels. To prevent any possible nuclear criticality, TEPCO planned to dump [[boric acid]] into the reactor and to increase the volume of cooling water by 3 tons per hour.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (12 February 2012)[http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/society.html Temperature rising at No.2 reactor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127083730/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/society.html |date=27 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since only one of the temperature-sensors showed fluctuating readings between 70&amp;nbsp;°C and 90&amp;nbsp;°C, TEPCO and NISA thought this sensor was malfunctioning. The sensor works on the principle of changing resistance between the surface of two different metals as the temperature changes. TEPCO planned measurements on this sensor.{{vague|date=February 2012}} Since the radiation around reactor 2 could make it impossible to place new sensors inside the reactor vessel, the situation would become very serious if the other two sensors inside the reactor were to also fail. After that, it would be impossible to monitor the reactor. Kazuhiko Kudo, a professor of nuclear engineering at the university of [[Kyushu, Japan]] commented: "Because we haven't been able to grasp how the nuclear fuel in the cores has been distributed, it's impossible to rule out localized high temperature spots. As the high radiation rules out installing new temperature sensors, if the last two sensors fail, the situation will be much more serious indeed."&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (n) (13 February 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120213p2a00m0na015000c.html Possible sensor failure throws Fukushima reactor temp. data into doubt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215133311/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120213p2a00m0na015000c.html# |date=15 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (13 February 2012)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1329122836P.pdf Earthquake report 346: TEPCO carefully monitoring No.2 reactor]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (13 February 2012)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1329122836P.pdf Earthquake report 346:One reading of Fukushima reactor exceeds 80 C]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 February, TEPCO sent a report to the Japanese government about the malfunctioning temperature-sensors and has since ceased monitoring that sensor. The other two temperature-sensors and the radiation levels inside the containment vessel would be used to monitor the state of the cold shutdown. The amount of cooling water would be lowered, after NISA's approval.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/20120216_31.html TEPCO reports reactor thermometer problem to govt] 16 February 2012 {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 April 2012, one of the two remaining temperature-sensors at the bottom of the No.2 reactor gave false readings, and because the electric resistance was found greatly increased, TEPCO concluded that it was broken, leaving only 18 of 36 temperature sensors still functioning. At 11 a.m., the remaining thermometer at this place measured 46.7 degrees Celsius.&lt;ref&gt;The Japan Times (15 April 2012) [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120415x1.html Another thermometer breaks at Fukushima]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June 2012 TEPCO reported that another thermometer had malfunctioned, resulting in more than half of the temperature sensors, 23 out of 41, now being out of use in reactor No. 2., thus making it more problematic to monitor the state of "cold-shutdown". According to TEPCO, the high humidity in the reactor may be a contributing factor in the failure of the sensors. TEPCO stated that it is currently decontaminating the site and training workers to install new thermometers. The plan is to install new thermometers through pipes that are connected to the reactor. TEPCO stated that it plans to decontaminate the site and install the new thermometers by late July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (4 June 2012) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1338801944P.pdf Earthquake-report 435: Thermometers malfunctioning at No.2 reactor] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BDBEOuAX?url=http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1338801944P.pdf |date=6 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 June 2012 TEPCO reported that a robot that was sent into the No. 2 reactor building on 13 June 2012 to take video images and radiation measurements, detected a reading of 880mSv (millisieverts) per hour of radiation on the fifth floor, which one floor (4.5 meters) directly above the reactor containment vessel. TEPCO suspects that during initial accident in March 2011, that radioactive substances leaked from the No. 2 reactor moved through the building, but after analyzing the images taken by the robot it could not find the exact route the radioactive substances traveled, and images taken by the robot found no major damage on the fifth floor. During the March 2011 nuclear accident the No. 2 reactor is believed to have released the largest amount of radioactive substances. But the overall route the radioactive material traveled has yet to be determined. TEPCO needs to find and repair the damaged parts of the reactor to recover melted nuclear fuel before TEPCO can begin the process of decommissioning the reactor. However high radiation often stops workers from entering the building. This scenario means it will take a long time to find the problems in the containment vessel.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (15 June 2012) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1339751546P.pdf Earthquake. report 444: High radiation one floor above reactor]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 October 2012 TEPCO installed a new temperature-sensor inside reactor nr.2. The thermometer showed 42.6 degrees Celsius, another nearby the RPV bottom monitoring instrument (TE-2-3-69H3) indicated 46.1 degrees. At that moment only 1 out of the existing 5 sensors was functioning properly.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (4 October 2012) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/20121004_15.html Fukushima plant's reactor No.2 has new thermometer]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pressure vessel damage===
On 15 May, TEPCO revealed that the pressure vessel that holds nuclear fuel "is likely to be damaged and leaking water at Units&amp;nbsp;2 and 3", which means most of the thousands of tons of water pumped into the reactors had leaked.&lt;ref name="WSJCoresDamaged"/&gt;

===Meltdown===
On 29 March, Richard Lahey, former head of safety research for boiling-water reactors at General Electric, speculated that the reactor core may have melted through the reactor containment vessel onto a concrete floor, raising concerns of a major release of radioactive material, while failing to divulge the report by Dale G. Bridenbaugh which condemned the design as "unsafe".&lt;ref name="Reactor core melted"/&gt; On 27 April, TEPCO revised its estimate of damaged fuel in Unit 2 from 30% to 35%.&lt;ref name="n1"/&gt;
TEPCO reported on 23 May that Reactor 2 suffered a meltdown about 100 hours after the earthquake.&lt;ref name="BBCConfirmMelt"/&gt;

===Concerns over re-criticality===

On 1 November 2011 TEPCO said that xenon-133 and xenon-135 were detected in gas-samples taken from the containment vessel of reactor 2, in a concentration of 6 to 10 (or more) parts per million becquerels per cubic centimeter. Xenon-135 was also detected in gas samples collected on 2 November. These isotopes are the result of nuclear fission-reaction of uranium. Because the short half-lifes of these gases: (Xe-133: 5 days Xe-135: 9 hours), the presence could only mean that nuclear fissions were occurring at some places in the reactor. Boric-acid was poured into the reactor in an attempt to stop the fission-reactions. No significant change in temperature or pressure was found by TEPCO, so there was no sign of large-scale criticality. The reactor-cooling was continued, but TEPCO would examine the situation at reactor 1 and 3 also.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (2 November 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/society.html TEPCO: Reactor may have gone critical] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127083730/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/society.html |date=27 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Earthuake-report 253"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (2 November 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111102p2g00m0dm008000c.html TEPCO finds sign of fresh nuclear fission at Fukushima reactor] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103191156/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111102p2g00m0dm008000c.html |date=3 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-11-02/tepco-detects-nuclear-fission-at-damaged-fukushima-station.html Businessweek (2 November 2011)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230050434/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-11-02/tepco-detects-nuclear-fission-at-damaged-fukushima-station.html |date=30 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Koji Okamoto of the [[University of Tokyo]] Graduate School made the comment that localized and temporary fission might still happen, and that the melted fuel could undergo fission, but the fuel was probably scattered around. Neutrons from radioactive materials could react with the uranium fuel and other substances. Self-sustaining chain reactions were unlikely, thanks to the huge amounts of boric acid that were poured into the reactor.
According to Okamoto, these neutrons should be closely monitored to make sure fission did not happen, because when the fission-reactions were not controlled, it would be impossible to reach a state of "cold-shutdown". Therefore, it was needed to locate all molten fuel in and outside the reactor-vessel.&lt;ref name="Earthuake-report 253"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (2 November 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/02_13.html Xenon suggests possible nuclear fission] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404005344/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/02_13.html# |date=4 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 November 2011 TEPCO said that the tiny amounts of xenon-135 detected in the reactor's containment vessel atmosphere came from spontaneous nuclear fission with curium-242 and curium-244, substances that were present in the nuclear fuel. A critical fission would have caused much higher concentrations of xenon isotopes. These reactions would occur constantly, and did not lead to criticality in the melted fuel of reactor 2. All assessments would be sent to NISA for reevaluation.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (3 November 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/03_19.html TEPCO retracts criticality call] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403033228/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/03_19.html# |date=3 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (3 November 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1320374709P.pdf Earthquake-report 255] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103124954/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1320374709P.pdf |date=3 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (4 November 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111103p2g00m0dm037000c.html Xenon at Fukushima not result of 'critical' nuclear reactions: TEPCO] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105235913/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111103p2g00m0dm037000c.html |date=5 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The detection of xenon on the afternoon of 1 November by TEPCO was reported to NISA in the night. The next day, 2 November just past 7 a.m., NISA informed the Prime Minister [[Yoshihiko Noda]]'s secretary about the possibility of critical reactions in reactor 2. Two hours later at 9 a.m. prime minister Edano learned the news. At a press-conference, the Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura revealed that Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Yukio Edano sent a strong reprimand to Hiroyuki Fukano, the chief of NISA, because NISA failed to report the incident immediately to both himself and the Prime Minister's Office, and that NISA waited almost a day after the find was done. Fujimura said, "I have been told that NISA decided not to report the incident until the following morning because the agency didn't believe it was a dangerous situation."&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (3 November 2011)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111103p2a00m0na001000c.html Minister reprimands NISA chief for tardy reporting of xenon detection at Fukushima plant] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104042020/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111103p2a00m0na001000c.html |date=4 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radioactive pollution of groundwater===
On 27 July 2013 was announced that extremely high levels of tritium and cesium were found in a pit containing about 5000 cubic meters water on the seaside of the unit 2 reactor building. 8.7 million becquerels/liter Tritium was found and 2.35 billion becquerels/liter cesium. The NRA was concerned that leaks from this place could cause the high tritium levels in sea, and that there was still water flowing from the reactor into the turbine building into the pit. But TEPCO thought that this pollution was there from the first days in 2011, and stayed there. Nevertheless, TEPCO would control the site for leaks, and seal the soil around the pit.&lt;ref&gt;The Asahi Shimbun (28 July 2013) [http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201307290043 Extremely high tritium level found in water in pit at Fukushima plant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801172215/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201307290043 |date=1 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acton|James Acton]], Associate of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, "Fukushima is not the worst nuclear accident ever but it is the most complicated and the most dramatic&amp;nbsp;... This was a crisis that played out in real time on TV. Chernobyl did not."&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant comprises six separate [[boiling water reactor]]s originally designed by [[General Electric]] (GE), and maintained by the [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]] (TEPCO). At the time of the quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold [[shutdown (nuclear reactor)|shutdown]] for planned maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Black, Richard |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12745186 |title= Reactor breach worsens prospects |work=BBC Online |date=15 March 2011 |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1-3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. However the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed. The flooded generators failed, cutting power to the critical pumps that must continuously circulate [[Nuclear reactor coolant#Water|coolant water]] through a nuclear reactor for several days in order to keep it from melting down after being shut down. As the pumps stopped, the [[Decay heat#Power reactors in shutdown|reactors overheated]] due to the normal high radioactive [[decay heat]] produced in the first few days after nuclear reactor shutdown (smaller amounts of this heat normally continue to be released for years, but are not enough to cause fuel melting).

At this point, only prompt flooding of the reactors with seawater could have cooled the reactors quickly enough to prevent meltdown. Salt water flooding was delayed because it would ruin the costly reactors permanently. Flooding with seawater was finally commenced only after the government ordered that seawater be used, and at this point it was already too late to prevent meltdown.&lt;ref&gt;F. Tanabe, Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology, 2011, volume 48, issue 8, pages 1135 to 1139&lt;/ref&gt;

As the water boiled away in the reactors and the water levels in the [[Spent nuclear fuel|fuel]] rod pools dropped, the reactor fuel rods began to overheat severely, and to melt down. In the hours and days that followed, Reactors 1, 2 and 3 experienced full [[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/06/06/japan.nuclear.meltdown/index.html?iref=NS1 |title=3 nuclear reactors melted down after quake, Japan confirms |work=CNN|date= 7 June 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T110607005367.htm |title='Melt-through' at Fukushima? / Govt report to IAEA suggests situation worse than meltdown |work=Yomiuri |date=8 June 2011 |accessdate=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. As workers struggled to cool and shut down the reactors, several [[Hydrogen safety|hydrogen-air]] chemical explosions occurred.&lt;ref name="IAEA15March"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyer.eu/news/regional-news/hydrogen-in-nuclear-accidents-what-is-the-role-of-the-gas-in-fukushima Hydrogen explosions Fukushima nuclear plant: what happened?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235552/http://www.hyer.eu/news/regional-news/hydrogen-in-nuclear-accidents-what-is-the-role-of-the-gas-in-fukushima |date=2 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns about the repeated small explosions, the atmospheric venting of radioactive gasses, and the possibility of larger explosions led to a {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}}-radius evacuation around the plant. During the early days of the accident workers were temporarily evacuated at various times for [[radiation]] safety reasons. At the same time, sea water that had been exposed to the melting rods was returned to the sea heated and radioactive in large volumes for several months until recirculating units could be put in place to repeatedly cool and re-use a limited quantity of water for cooling. The earthquake damage and flooding in the wake of the tsunami hindered external assistance. Electrical power was slowly restored for some of the reactors, allowing for automated cooling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704021504576210251376606080 Stricken reactors may get power Sunday], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 19 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

An "Official Use Only" report obtained by FOIA from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (3/18/2011) written one week after the tsunami hit Fukushima states, “The source term provided to [[National Atmospheric Release Advisory Center|NARAC]] was: (1) 25% of the total fuel in unit 2 released to the atmosphere, (2) 50% of the total spent fuel from unit 3 was released to the atmosphere, and (3) 100% of the total spent fuel was released to the atmosphere from unit 4.”&lt;ref&gt;http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML1212/ML12122A949.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; NARAC produced a "worst case" speculative model based on these assumptions. However, this model did not include an assumption of a release from Unit 1, and the assumption of "100% of the total spent fuel was released to the atmosphere from unit 4" has since been proven incorrect with the subsequent removal of the fuel from the spent pool fuel.

==Unit 3 Reactor==
[[File:Fukushima I by Digital Globe crop.jpg|thumb|Reactor Unit 3 (right) and Unit 4 (left) on 16 March.&lt;br /&gt; Three of the reactors at Fukushima Daiichi overheated, causing meltdowns which released large amounts of [[radioactive]] material into the air.&lt;br /&gt; Pipes are the direction of the [[Pacific Ocean|ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/world/asia/02japan.html |title=Report Finds Japan Underestimated Tsunami Danger |author=Martin Fackler |date=1 June 2011 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Unlike the other five reactor units, reactor 3 ran on mixed core, containing both uranium fuel and mixed uranium and [[plutonium oxide]], or [[MOX fuel]] (with the core comprising ~6% MOX fuel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://safetyfirst.nei.org/ask-an-expert/what-fuel-mix-was-in-use-at-fukushima-and-was-that-a-factor-in-the-accident-does-the-united-states-use-mox-fuel/ |title=What fuel mix was in use at Fukushima and was that a factor in the accident? Does the United States use MOX fuel? |date=25 July 2011 |work=Nuclear Energy Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt;), during a loss of cooling accident in a subcritical reactor MOX fuel will not behave differently from UOX fuel. The key difference between plutonium-239 and uranium-235 is that plutonium emits fewer delayed neutrons than uranium when it undergoes fission.&lt;ref&gt;{{X. Li, R. Henkelmann and F. Baumgärtner, Rapid determination of uranium and plutonium content in mixtures through measurement of the intensity-time curve of delayed neutrons, NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS &amp; METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS, 2004, volume 215, issue 1–2, pages 246–251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While water-insoluble forms of plutonium such as [[plutonium dioxide]] are very harmful to the lungs, this toxicity is not relevant during a Loss Of Coolant Accident (LOCA) because plutonium is very involatile and unlikely to leave the reactor in large amounts. Plutonium dioxide has a very high boiling point. The toxic effect of the plutonium to the public under these conditions is much less than that of [[iodine-131]] and caesium. During a loss of cooling accident, the fuel is not subject to such intense mechanical stresses, so the release of radioactivity is controlled by the boiling-point of the different elements present.&lt;ref&gt;J.-P. Hiernaut, T. Wiss, D. Papaioannou, R.J.M. Konings, V.V. Rondinella, Journal of Nuclear Materials, 2008, volume 372, pages 215 to 225&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooling problems===
Following the reactor SCRAM, operators activated the reactor core isolation cooling system (RCIC) and the residual heat removal system and core spray systems were made available to cool the suppression pool; whether they were activated prior to the tsunami has not been made clear. The RHRS and CS pumps were knocked out of commission by the tsunami. With DC battery power remaining, the RCIC continued to keep the water level stable, and the operators switched to the high pressure coolant injection (HPCI) system when water level began to drop. On 13 March, the HPCI system failed, the reason for which is not completely clear due to instrumentation not being available. It is believed to be either due to loss of DC power due to depletion of batteries or to reactor pressure dropping below the level at which it can operate. Operators were unable to restart it as batteries were exhausted. After this the operators were unable to start the RCIC system and began injecting seawater. Although it was not clear at the time, some of the fuel in Reactor 3 apparently melted around sixty hours after the earthquake (the night of the 12th to 13th).&lt;ref name="BBCConfirmMelt"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13497656 |title=Tepco confirms extra partial fuel rod meltdown at plant |work=BBC |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on 13 March an official of the Japan Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) told at a news conference that the emergency cooling system of Unit 3 had failed, spurring an urgent search for a means to supply cooling water to the reactor vessel to prevent a meltdown of its reactor core.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/12/us-japan-quake-nuclear-cooling-idUSTRE72B3GI20110312 |title=Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant faces new reactor problem |work=Reuters |date=12 March 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 05:38 there was no means of adding coolant to the reactor, owing to loss of power.

===Cooling efforts===
Around 10:00 JST on 16 March, NHK helicopters flying 30&amp;nbsp;km away videotaped white fumes rising from the Fukushima I facility. Officials suggested that the Reactor 3 building was the most likely source, and said that its containment systems may have been breached.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/16/world/asia/16nuclear.htm "Japan says 2nd reactor may have ruptured with radioactive release"], ''The New York Times'' 16 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The control room for Reactors 3 and 4 was evacuated at 10:45 JST but staff were cleared to return and resume water injection into the reactor at 11:30 JST.&lt;ref name=nisa26&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nisa.meti.go.jp/english/files/en20110317-1.pdf |title=Seismic damage information (the 26th release) |date=16 March 2011 |work=Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency |accessdate=12 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xs2XnNkb?url=http://www.nisa.meti.go.jp/english/files/en20110317-1.pdf |archivedate=11 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
At 16:12 JST, Self Defence Force (SDF) [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook|Chinook helicopters]] were preparing to pour water on Unit 3, where white fumes rising from the building was believed to be water boiling away from the fuel rod cooling pond on the top floor of the reactor building, and on Unit 4 where the cooling pool was also short of water.

On 23 March, black smoke billowed from Unit 3, prompting another evacuation of workers from the plant, though Tokyo Electric Power Co. officials said there had been no corresponding spike in radiation at the plant. "We don't know the reason for the smoke", Hidehiko Nishiyama of the Nuclear Safety Agency said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/templates/Print_This_Story?sid=118421284 |title=Tokyo tap water tests higher for radiation; smoke prompts new evacuation of leaking nuke plant |work=StarTribune.com |date=23 March 2011 |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 March, three workers entered the basement of the turbine building and were exposed to radiation when they stepped into contaminated water. Two of them were not wearing high boots and received [[beta ray]] burns. They were hospitalized but their injuries were not life-threatening.&lt;ref name="Japan Times 2-6 sieverts detected"&gt;{{cite web|title=Level of iodine-131 in seawater off chart|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110326x1.html|work=Japan Times|accessdate=27 March 2011|authors=Kanako Takahara and Kazuaki Nagata|date=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 25 March, the source of water being injected into the core was switched from seawater to freshwater.&lt;ref name=110819e2/&gt;

In August, TEPCO began considering changing the core injection method for the no. 3 reactor as it was requiring a much larger quantity of water to cool and the temperatures remained relatively high compared to the nos. 1 and 2 reactors which required far less water. TEPCO has hypothesized that this may be because some fuel is still present above the core support plate inside the pressure vessel of the no. 3 reactor in addition to the fuel that has fallen to the bottom of the pressure vessel. The fuel on the bottom would be easily cooled by the existing method, but as the pressure vessel is leaking, any fuel located on the support plate was likely only being cooled due to the steam generated by the cooling of the melted fuel at the bottom. TEPCO began considering utilizing the reactor's core spray system pipes as an additional path of water injection and then reduce the amount of water through the existing feedwater piping system. A team of workers were sent inside the reactor building to inspect the core spray system pipes and it was found that the piping was undamaged. Hoses were then run from the temporary injection pumps located outside the building and connected to the core spray system piping. On 1 September, TEPCO began injecting water using the new route. The new injection method has been considerably effective in lowering the temperature of the reactor to below 100 degrees Celsius. As of 27 September, most of the no. 3 reactor's temperature readings are between 70–80 degrees Celsius. Later, TEPCO began utilizing the same method in the no. 2 reactor; it has not had as significant effect on the no. 2 reactor as it did on the no. 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/11092705-e.html |title=Plant status of Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 March 2011, officials announced the reactor vessel might be breached and leaking radioactive material. High radiation levels from contaminated water prevented work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/03/25/japan.nuclear.reactors/ |title=Japan reactor core may be leaking radioactive material, official says |work=CNN |date=25 March 2011|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) reiterated concerns about a Unit 3 breach on 30 March.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/30_25.html |title=Air may be leaking from reactors No. 2 and 3 |work=NHK WORLD English |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=2 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511120313/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/30_25.html |archivedate=11 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; NHK World reported the NISA's concerns as "air may be leaking", very probably through "weakened valves, pipes and openings under the reactors where the control rods are inserted", but that "there is no indication of large cracks or holes in the reactor vessels".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; As with the other reactors, water was transferred from condenser reservoirs to the suppression pool surge tanks so that condensers could be used to hold radioactive water pumped from the basement.&lt;ref name=TEPCO30-3:20&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/11033015-e.html |title=Press Release &amp;#124; Status of TEPCO's Facilities and its services after the Tohoku-Taiheiyou-Oki Earthquake(as of 10:00 pm) |work=TEPCO |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 April, remote control robots were used to enter the Reactor Building and performed a series of inspections.&lt;ref name=110819e2/&gt; On 27 April, TEPCO revised its estimate of damaged fuel in Unit 3 from 25% to 30%.&lt;ref name=n1/&gt; Radiation measurements of the water in the Unit 3 spent fuel pool were reported at 140 kBq of radioactive caesium-134 per cubic centimeter, 150 kBq of caesium-137 per cubic centimeter, and 11 kBq per cubic centimeter of iodine-131 on 10 May.&lt;ref name="n4"/&gt;

On 15 May, TEPCO revealed that the pressure vessel that holds nuclear fuel "is likely to be damaged and leaking water at Units&amp;nbsp;2 and 3", which meant most of the thousands of tons of water pumped into the reactors had leaked.&lt;ref name=WSJCoresDamaged/&gt; On 23 May, TEPCO reported that Reactor 3 had suffered a meltdown some sixty hours after the earthquake.&lt;ref name="BBCConfirmMelt" /&gt;

On 9 June, staff entered the Reactor Building to conduct radiation surveys.&lt;ref name=110819e2/&gt; On 25 June and the following day [[boric acid]] dissolved in 90 tons of water was pumped into the spent fuel pool of Reactor 3. Concrete debris from the March hydrogen explosion of the reactor building have been detected in the spent fuel pool. In June TEPCO discovered that the water in the pool was strongly alkaline: the pH had reached a value of 11.2. Leaching of [[calcium hydroxide]] ([[portlandite]]) or [[calcium silicate hydrate]] (CSH) from the [[concrete]] could have caused this. The alkaline water could accelerate the corrosion of the [[aluminium]] racks holding the spent fuel rods. If the fuel assemblies would fall, this could lead to re-[[criticality accident|criticality]]. In the mean time preparative works began to install a recirculation cooling system at the fuel pool, that should be operational in the first weeks of July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/26_11.html# |title=Boric acid added to spent fuel pool of Unit 3. |access-date=30 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402003858/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/26_11.html# |archive-date=2 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 July, TEPCO began injecting nitrogen into the containment vessel, which was expected to reduce the likelihood of further hydrogen explosions.&lt;ref name=110819e2/&gt; On 1 July, the spent fuel pool was switched from the water-injection cooling system, to a circulatory cooling system.&lt;ref name=110819e2/&gt; After 2 July, the Reactor was cooled using fresh water treated by the on-site water treatment plant.&lt;ref name=110819e2/&gt;

On 11 January 2012, radioactive contaminated water was found in two underground tunnels. On 12 January, TEPCO admitted that around 300 cubic meters of water had accumulated in an underground tunnel near reactor No.3, with electric cables. Radioactive caesium was measured in concentrations varying from 49 to 69 becquerels per cubic centimeter. Smaller amounts of contaminated water with lower concentrations caesium was found in a tunnel near reactor no.1. How the water could accumulate at these places was under examination.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily news (13 January 2012) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120113p2g00m0dm020000c.html 300 tons of tainted water found near No. 3 unit at Fukushima plant] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115021726/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120113p2g00m0dm020000c.html |date=15 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the morning of 18 July 2013 at 8:20&amp;nbsp;a.m. (2320 GMT) small amounts of steam escaped from the reactor building. Video images made by a subcontractor, filming the destroyed building and preparing to remove rubble from the place, showed some vapors rising, but it was unclear where it came from. Although there was no change in the afternoon, TEPCO said that radiation levels did not change, and the reactor was still cooled.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (18 July 2013) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130718p2g00m0dm066000c.html TEPCO sees steam but no crisis at nuclear plant] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721094208/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130718p2g00m0dm066000c.html# |date=21 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to TEPCO rain could have found its way to the primary containment of the reactor, and because this vessel was still hot, it could cause the steam.&lt;ref&gt;The Asahi Shimbun (18 July 2013) [http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201307180037 Steam rising from reactor building in Fukushima] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724060822/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201307180037# |date=24 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The next day at 7:55&amp;nbsp;a.m. the steam was gone. Because the radiation levels were too high all work to remove rubble was done by remote control. Operations stopped after the steam was found.

==Summary of events==

The plant comprises six separate [[boiling water reactor]]s originally designed by [[General Electric]] (GE), and maintained by the [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]] (TEPCO). At the time of the quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold [[shutdown (nuclear reactor)|shutdown]] for planned maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Black, Richard |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12745186 |title= Reactor breach worsens prospects |work=BBC Online |date=15 March 2011 |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1-3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. However the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed. The flooded generators failed, cutting power to the critical pumps that must continuously circulate [[Nuclear reactor coolant#Water|coolant water]] through a nuclear reactor for several days in order to keep it from melting down after being shut down. As the pumps stopped, the [[Decay heat#Power reactors in shutdown|reactors overheated]] due to the normal high radioactive [[decay heat]] produced in the first few days after nuclear reactor shutdown (smaller amounts of this heat normally continue to be released for years, but are not enough to cause fuel melting). At this point, only prompt flooding of the reactors with seawater could have cooled the reactors quickly enough to prevent meltdown.  Salt water flooding was delayed because it would ruin the costly reactors permanently.  Flooding with seawater was finally commenced only after the government ordered that seawater be used, and at this point it was already too late to prevent meltdown.&lt;ref&gt;F. Tanabe, Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology, 2011, volume 48, issue 8, pages 1135 to 1139&lt;/ref&gt;

As the water boiled away in the reactors and the water levels in the [[Spent nuclear fuel|fuel]] rod pools dropped, the reactor fuel rods began to overheat severely, and to melt down.  In the hours and days that followed, Reactors 1, 2 and 3 experienced full [[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/06/06/japan.nuclear.meltdown/index.html?iref=NS1 |title=3 nuclear reactors melted down after quake, Japan confirms |work=CNN|date= 7 June 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T110607005367.htm |title='Melt-through' at Fukushima? / Govt report to IAEA suggests situation worse than meltdown |work=Yomiuri |date=8 June 2011 |accessdate=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. As workers struggled to cool and shut down the reactors, several [[hydrogen explosion|hydrogen-air]] chemical explosions occurred.&lt;ref name="IAEA15March"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hyer.eu/news/regional-news/hydrogen-in-nuclear-accidents-what-is-the-role-of-the-gas-in-fukushima |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235552/http://www.hyer.eu/news/regional-news/hydrogen-in-nuclear-accidents-what-is-the-role-of-the-gas-in-fukushima |archivedate=2 December 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns about the repeated small explosions, the atmospheric venting of radioactive gasses, and the possibility of larger explosions led to a {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}}-radius evacuation around the plant. During the early days of the accident workers were temporarily evacuated at various times for [[radiation]] safety reasons. At the same time, sea water that had been exposed to the melting rods was returned to the sea heated and radioactive in large volumes for several months until recirculating units could be put in place to repeatedly cool and re-use a limited quantity of water for cooling.  The earthquake damage and flooding in the wake of the tsunami hindered external assistance.  Electrical power was slowly restored for some of the reactors, allowing for automated cooling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704021504576210251376606080 Stricken reactors may get power Sunday], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 19 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese officials initially assessed the accident as Level 4 on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]] (INES) despite the views of other international agencies that it should be higher. The level was later raised to 5 and eventually to 7, the maximum scale value.&lt;ref&gt;Justin McCurry.

=== UNSCEAR Report ===
Annex A of the UNSCEAR (United Nations Scientific Committee for the Effects of Atomic Radiation) 2013 report to the UN General Assembly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/2013/13-85418_Report_2013_Annex_A.pdf|title=Levels and effects of radiation exposure due to the nuclear accident after the 2011 great east-Japan earthquake and tsunami}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that the average effective dose of the 25,000 workers over the first 19 months after the accident was about 12 millisieverts (mSv).  About 0.7% of the workforce received doses of more than 100 mSv (Chapter II A(b) paragraph 35).  No radiation-related deaths or acute diseases have been observed among the workers and general public exposed to radiation from the accident (Chapter II A(b) paragraph 38).  Adults living in the city of Fukushima were estimated to have received, on average, an effective dose of about 4 mSv (Chapter II A(a) paragraph 30).  No discernible increased incidence of radiation-related health effects are expected among exposed members of the public or their descendants (Chapter II A(b) paragraph 39).  Average annual exposure in the region from naturally occurring sources is about 2.1 mSv, and average lifetime exposure is 170 mSv (Chapter II A(2) paragraph 29). For comparison, the average dose from an abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan, with and without contrast, is 20 to 30 mSv.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info.cfm?pg=safety-xray | title = Radiation Dose in X-Ray and CT Exams | accessdate = 2018-08-26 | publisher = Radiological Society of North America, Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Radiation Dose Associated with Common Computed Tomography Examinations and the Associated Lifetime Attributable Risk of Cancer | doi = 10.1001/archinternmed.2009.427 | first1 = Rebecca | last1 = Smith-Bindman | first2 = Jafi | last2 = Lipson | first3 = Ralph | last3 = Marcus |display-authors=etal | date = 2009-12-14 | pmid=20008690 | pmc=4635397 | volume=169 | issue = 22 | journal=Arch Intern Med | pages=2078–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== WHO Report ===
In 2013, two years after the incident, the [[World Health Organization]] indicated that the residents of the area who were evacuated were exposed to so little radiation that radiation induced health impacts are likely to be below detectable levels.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/78218/1/9789241505130_eng.pdf |title=Health risk assessment from the nuclear accident after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami |website=Apps.who.int |accessdate=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The health risks in the WHO assessment attributable to the Fukushima radioactivity release were calculated by largely applying the conservative [[Linear no-threshold model|Linear no-threshold]] model of radiation exposure, a model that assumes even the smallest amount of radiation exposure will cause a negative health effect.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The [[WHO]] calculations using this model determined that the most at risk group, [[infant]]s, who were in the most affected area, would experience an absolute increase in the risk of [[cancer]](of all types) during their lifetime, of approximately 1% due to the accident. With the lifetime risk increase for [[thyroid cancer]], due to the accident, for a female infant, in the most affected radiation location, being estimated to be one half of one percent [0.5%].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walsh |first=Bryan |url=http://science.time.com/2013/03/01/meltdown-despite-the-fear-the-health-risks-from-the-fukushima-accident-are-minimal/#ixzz2MnbjhPmv |title=WHO Report Says That Fukushima Nuclear Accident Posed Minimal Risk to Health &amp;#124; TIME.com |journal=Time |date=2013-03-01 |accessdate=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Cancer risks for the [[in utero|unborn child]] are considered to be similar to those in 1 year old infants.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The estimated risk of cancer to people who were children and adults during the Fukushima accident, in the most affected area, was determined to be lower again when compared to the most at risk group - [[infant]]s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  A thyroid ultrasound screening programme is currently[2013] ongoing in the entire Fukushima prefecture, this screening programme is, due to the [[Screening (medicine)|screening effect]], likely to lead to an increase in the incidence of thyroid disease due to early detection of non-[[symptomatic]] disease cases.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
About one third of people [33.3%] in industrialized nations are presently diagnosed with cancer during their lifetimes, radiation exposure can increase one's cancer risk, with the cancers that arise being indistinguishable from cancers resulting from other causes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

No increase is expected in the incidence of [[congenital]] or developmental abnormalities, including cognitive impairment attributable to [[in utero|within the womb]] radiation exposure.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; As no radiation induced [[Heredity|inherited]] effects/heritable effects, nor [[teratogenic]] effects, have ever been definitely demonstrated in humans, with studies on the health of children conceived by cancer survivors who received [[radiotherapy]], and the children of the [[Hibakusha]], not finding a definitive increase in inherited disease or congenital abnormalities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; No increase in these effects are therefore expected in or around the Fukushima power plants.

In a nuclear accident situation it is essential for authorities to understand and communicate the direction that contamination is spreading and where it may be deposited on land. Given this information, as well as basic knowledge of the risks of radiation, residents would not feel unnecessary anxiety.&lt;ref name="The health effects of Fukushima"/&gt;

The wind measurably increased the radiation levels up to 100 miles away from the disaster site. Radioactive iodine, which can lead to increased risk of thyroid cancer if absorbed into the body, was released into the air along with other fission products. To counteract the radioactive iodine the distribution of potassium iodide is used, as it prevents the absorption of the potentially dangerous radioisotopes of that element. Since Chernobyl, distributing potassium iodide to children has been a standard response when risk of radioactivity release is high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/japans-fukushima-nuclear-plant-health-risks-meltdown/story?id=13122447#.ULYWzqz7KSp |title=Fear in Fukushima: What Are the Health Risks of Radiation? |work=ABC News |date=12 March 2011 |accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, the United States Department of Energy published projections of the radiation risks over the next year for people living in the neighborhood of the plant. Potential exposure could exceed 20&amp;nbsp;mSv/year (2 rems/year) in some areas up to 50 kilometers from the plant. That is the level at which relocation would be considered in the USA, and it is a level that could cause roughly one extra cancer case in 500 young adults. Natural radiation levels are higher in some part of the world than the projected level mentioned above, and about 4 people out of 10 can be expected to develop cancer without exposure to radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.slideshare.net/energy/radiation-monitoring-data-from-fukushima-area-04182011 | work = United States Department of Energy | title = Radiological Assessment of effects from Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant | date = 16 April 2011 | accessdate =20 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/04/a-map-of-fukushimas-radiation.html |title = A Map of Fukushima's Radiation Risks | work = American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAA) | author = Jocelyn Kaiser | date = 22 April 2011 | accessdate =20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the radiation exposure resulting from the accident for most people living in Fukushima is so small compared to background radiation that it may be impossible to find statistically significant evidence of increases in cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Fukushima Revives The Low-Dose Debate | author = Dennis Normile | journal = Science | pages = 908–910 | volume = 332 | date = 20 May 2011 | doi = 10.1126/science.332.6032.908 | issue=6032 | pmid=21596968|bibcode = 2011Sci...332..908N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2012|9}}, there were no deaths or serious injuries due to direct radiation exposures. Cancer deaths due to accumulated radiation exposures cannot be ruled out, and according to one expert, might be in the order of 100 cases.&lt;ref name="Caracappa-ANS"/&gt; A May 2012 United Nations committee report stated that none of the six Fukushima workers who had died since the tsunami had died from radiation exposure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jiji Press]]/[[Associated Press]], "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120525a2.html Radiation didn't cause Fukushima No. 1 deaths: U.N.]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 25 May 2012, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2012 [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] survey, 573 deaths have been certified as "disaster-related" by 13 municipalities affected by the Fukushima nuclear disaster. These municipalities are in the no-entry, emergency evacuation preparation or expanded evacuation zones around the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant. A disaster-related death certificate is issued when a death is not directly caused by a tragedy, but by "fatigue or the aggravation of a chronic disease due to the disaster".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T120204003191.htm|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120204190315/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T120204003191.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 February 2012|title=573 deaths certified as nuclear-crisis-related in Japan|date=4 Feb 2012|work=Yomiuri Shimbun|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a June 2012 Stanford University study by John Ten Hoeve and [[Mark Z. Jacobson]], the radioactivity released could cause 130 deaths from cancer (the lower bound for the estimater being 15 and the upper bound 1100) and 180 cancer cases (the lower bound being 24 and the upper bound 1800), mostly in Japan. Radiation exposure to workers at the plant was projected to result in 2 to 12 deaths. The radioactivity released was an order of magnitude lower than that released from Chernobyl, and some 80% of the radioactivity from Fukushima was deposited over the Pacific Ocean; preventive actions taken by the Japanese government may have substantially reduced the health impact of the radioactivity release. An additional approximately 600 deaths have been reported due to non-radiological causes such as mandatory evacuations. Evacuation procedures after the accident may have potentially reduced deaths from radiation by 3 to 245 cases, the best estimate being 28; even the upper bound projection of the lives saved from the evacuation is lower than the number of deaths already caused by the evacuation itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/TenHoeveEES12.pdf |author = John E.

These numbers are very low compared to the estimated 20,000 casualties caused by the tsunami itself, and it has been estimated that if Japan had never adopted nuclear power, accidents and pollution from coal or gas plants would have caused more lost years of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2012/07/nuclear-power-good-you |author= Dennis Normile |title= Is Nuclear Power Good for You? |journal=Science|page= 395 |volume= 337 |date= 27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, there has been a widely critiqued paper published by members of the controversial [[Radiation and Public Health Project]] which attempts to ascribe the natural annual cycle of rising and falling adult and [[infant mortality]] rates in the [[United States]] to Fukushima fallout, suggesting about 14,000 have died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Those who have responded to this paper in the literature have noted a number of errors, among them that this figure was based on an assumption of acute deaths from low radiation doses. There is no known mechanism for this, and "the cities under study with the lowest radiation fallout have the highest increases of death rates in the 14 weeks following Fukushima, while the Californian cities that would have received larger doses saw a decrease in death rate growth" and concluded that "innumerable factors other than radiation" were likely responsible for the major part of the variation in US mortality around the time of the nuclear disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The author of the initial paper which attempts to draw a link between infant mortality in the US and the Fukushima accident, Joseph Mangano and his colleague [[Ernest J.

Perinatal mortality in areas contaminated with radioactive substances started to increase 10 months after the nuclear accident relative to the prevailing and stable secular downward trend. These results are consistent with findings in
Europe after Chernobyl.Ten months after the earthquake and tsunami and the subsequent nuclear accident, perinatal mortality in 6 severely contaminated prefectures jumped up from January 2012 onward: jump odds ratio 1.156; 95% confidence interval (1.061, 1.259), P-value 0.0009. There were slight increases in areas with moderate levels of contamination and no increases in the rest of Japan. In severely contaminated areas, the increases of perinatal mortality 10 months after Fukushima were essentially independent of the numbers of dead and missing due to the earthquake and the tsunami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scherb HH, Mori K, Hayashi K |title=Increases in perinatal mortality in prefectures contaminated by the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident in Japan: A spatially stratified longitudinal study |journal=Medicine |volume=95 |issue=38 |pages=e4958 |year=2016 |pmid=27661055 |doi=10.1097/MD.0000000000004958 |pmc=5044925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] began on 11 March 2011, reactor unit 4, 5 and 6 were all shut down. An explosion damaged the unit 4 four days after the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]], Damages from the earthquake and tsunami on unit 5 and 6 are relatively minor.

The unit 4  was shut down and all fuel rods had been transferred to the [[spent fuel pool]] on an upper floor of the reactor building. On 15 March, an explosion damaged the fourth floor rooftop area of the unit 4 reactor; the source of the explosion is still unknown, although it is speculated to be due to hydrogen generation in the spent fuel pool. Japan's [[nuclear safety]] agency NISA reported two large holes in a wall of the outer building of unit 4 after the explosion. It was reported that water in the spent fuel pool might be boiling. Radiation inside the unit 4 control room prevented workers from staying there permanently. Visual inspection of the spent fuel pool of reactor 4 on 30 April showed that there was no significant visible damage to the fuel rods in the pool.

Reactors 5 and 6 were also shut down when the earthquake struck although, unlike reactor 4, they were still fueled. The reactors have been closely monitored, as cooling processes were not functioning well.

===Structural damage of reactor building no. 4===

On 24 June 2012 TEPCO revealed that some exterior walls were slightly out of vertical in reactor building no.4, due to the hydrogen explosion in March 2011. Further investigations showed damage in various parts of the building structures at the west and south side. At the third floor a wall was found to be leaning 4.6 centimeters out of vertical. All deviations were within legal limits, and the walls were strong enough to withstand an earthquake.

On 11 June, it was discovered that the water level in the spent fuel pool was only one third of normal, and only part of the fuel rods were covered with water. This was probably the cause of the high radiation levels measured. This pool has also been used to dump equipment. On Sunday 19 June, the pool was refilled, to minimize the radiation and making it possible to work again at this place.&lt;ref&gt;''NHK-world'' (20 June 2011)[http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/20_03.html Spent Fuel Pool refilled] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812060958/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/20_03.html |date=12 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 June, the first stage of strengthening at the second floor in the building under the pool was finished: 32 steel columns 8 meters long with a weight of 40 tons each were placed at the second floor.&lt;ref&gt;''NHK-world'' (21 June 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/21_03.html First stage strengthening of floor under spent fuel pool Reactor 4 finished] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810142535/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/21_03.html |date=10 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 30 July, the concreting of the supporting columns was completed.&lt;ref name=110819e2&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/betu11_e/images/110819e2.pdf  |title= Records from March 11, 2011 to July 31, 2011 |publisher=TEPCO |accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 16 June, water injection to the spent fuel pool was switched from using the concrete pumping vehicle to an alternative water injection line.&lt;ref name=110819e2/&gt;

On 31 July, the spent fuel pool was switched from the water-injection cooling system, to a circulatory cooling system.&lt;ref name=110819e2/&gt;

On 31 January 2012, six liters of radioactive water (35.500 becquerels per liter) leaked from the spent fuel pool of reactor 4 onto the floor in the building from a broken pipe. The leakage was stopped after a valve was closed, and was thought to have been caused by the cold weather.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (1 February 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120201p2g00m0dm150000c.html Radioactive water leaking from inside Fukushima No. 4 reactor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202021555/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120201p2g00m0dm150000c.html |date=2 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day (1 February 2012), TEPCO released an even higher figure: 8500 liters were leaked after a pipe was dropped off after the water inside had turned into ice. The leakage appeared to have started at around 5 p.m. on 31 January 2012. This water was contaminated with radioactive isotopes, because it was mixed with water that was in contact with the fuel rods from the spent-fuel pool. TEPCO made plans to check whether there were similar cases in the other damaged reactor buildings.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mainichi Daily News'' (2 February 2012) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120202p2g00m0dm028000c.html TEPCO says 8.5 tons of water leaked from Fukushima No. 4 reactor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205014501/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120202p2g00m0dm028000c.html |date=5 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 June 2012 around 6:25 hours local time, an alarm went off, and the cooling system of the spent fuel pool halted. At that time, the temperature was 33.3 degrees Celsius; no leakage of radioactive contaminated water was reported. On 4 June, a similar situation caused the cooling to be halted.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (30 June 2012)[http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120630p2g00m0dm049000c.html Cooling system suspended at Fukushima nuke plant No. 4 reactor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702131659/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120630p2g00m0dm049000c.html |date=2 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 July shortly after 3 p.m. the cooling was resumed, the water temperature of the pool having risen to 42.9&amp;nbsp;°C. TEPCO had feared that the temperature could reach 65&amp;nbsp;°C, the upper limit designated in safety regulations. The cause of the troubles was laid in some parts of the emergency power system, and these were to be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (2 July 2012)[http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120702p2g00m0dm022000c.html TEPCO resumes cooling Fukushima Daiichi No. 4 reactor fuel pool] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130219003724/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120702p2g00m0dm022000c.html |date=19 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March 2013 at 6:57&amp;nbsp;p.m., the cooling system for the spent fuel pools of the No. 1, 3 and 4 reactors stopped, after the electricity instantaneously went out at the plant's accident response center. TEPCO suspects that the problem was situated in one makeshift power switchboard controlling the cooling system. The injection of water into the Nos. 1, 2 and 3 reactors was not affected. According to TEPCO, restoring the cooling system of the spent fuel pool of reactor No. 4 had the "highest priority", because the number of fuel assemblies stored in that tank was larger than in the pools of unit 1, 2 and 3. On 19 March at 10 a.m., the temperatures ranged between 15.9 C and 30.5 C, and it would take about four days until the temperature of the water inside the No. 4 spent fuel pool reaches the upper safety limit of 65 C. TEPCO was prepared to inject water into the pool whenever needed in case the water warmed up and started to evaporate.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (19 March 2013) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130319p2g00m0dm064000c.html Fukushima nuclear plant's fuel pool cooling system still suspended] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130413125909/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130319p2g00m0dm064000c.html |date=13 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 March around 1:20&amp;nbsp;p.m., one of the two lines forming the cooling system of the No. 4 spent fuel pool was restored.

The news was communicated by the Nuclear Regulation Authority around three hours after the incident happened. On 22 March 2013, the evacuation zones were to be reclassified, and some residents would be allowed to make day trips to their homes. Some people thought that all was under control, and others with little children were afraid for yet another evacuation.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (19 March 2013)[http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130319p2g00m0dm026000c.html Fukushima residents irked by outage at crippled atomic plant] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130413130756/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130319p2g00m0dm026000c.html |date=13 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Electricity went out simultaneously at nine facilities of the plant in total, a filter system to remove radioactive materials from cooling water for the reactors, and a cooling system for yet another pool were affected too. TEPCO admitted, that this was the first occasion that such a power failure happened at so critical facilities at the site since the plant was brought under control in December 2011. On 20 March before 1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. all systems were online again. The cooling system of pool no. 4 was restored as last. TEPCO blamed a provisional power switchboard to be the cause of the troubles. According to TEPCO, this was the last remaining makeshift power switchboard at the plant, installed after the nuclear crisis. Criticism was there from the central and prefectural government, the late announcement three hours after the power loss had caused "significant anxiety" among local people. TEPCO promised that it would seek to communicate relevant information more quickly on issues that could stir public concern.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (20 March 2013) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130320p2g00m0dm001000c.html TEPCO restores Fukushima plant's spent fuel pool cooling system] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130413134339/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130320p2g00m0dm001000c.html |date=13 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the investigation to find the cause of the power loss, a 6-inch rat was found electrocuted near a switch board.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a press conference, that TEPCO was ordered to improve its risk management, that TEPCO had not promptly informed the authorities, and that TEPCO's handling of the power failure had greatly damaged public trust in the company.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (21 March 2013) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/20130322_01.html Govt. tells TEPCO to add multiple power sources]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concern about criticality in the spent fuel pool===
[[File:BoronFukushimaALT.jpg|thumb|[[Boric acid]] is airlifted to Fukushima for addition to cooling water.]]
Despite widely voiced concerns, the evidence suggests that the spent fuel pool at Unit 4 did not approach criticality at any stage.

====Boron injection====
Officials are reported to have considered insertion or targeted aerial dropping of [[boric acid]], boronated plastic beads or [[boron carbide]] pellets into the spent fuel pools to absorb [[neutron]]s.&lt;ref name="reuters1"/&gt; France flew 95 tonnes of [[boron]] to Japan on 17 March 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bungling, cover-ups define Japanese nuclear quake|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/special-features/japan-earthquake-new-explosion-rocks-fukushima-nuclear-power-plant/story-fn7zkbgs-1226022801346|accessdate=6 November 2014|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the US provided 9 tons.&lt;ref&gt;NHK, "US military playing key role in relief efforts", 29 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Neutron absorbing boric acid has been add to water injected into the reactor cores, but is unclear if boron was included with the spraying of [[spent fuel pool]]s (SFP)s.&lt;ref name="world-nuclear-news1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Battle to stabilise earthquake reactors|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS_Battle_to_stabilise_earthquake_reactors_1203111.html|publisher=World Nuclear News|accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Visual inspection====
Visual inspection of the spent fuel rod pool on Reactor 4 on 30 April 2011 showed that there is no significant visible damage to the fuel rods in the pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS_No_significant_damage_to_fuel_at_Unit_4_3004111.html |title=No significant damage to fuel at Unit 4 |publisher=world-nuclear-news.org |accessdate=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fuel Rods Removed====
On 22 December 2014, Tepco crews completed the removal of all fuel assemblies, and the spent fuel pool of Reactor 4 no longer contained any stored fuel rods. The majority of the spent fuel assemblies were moved to the common spent fuel pool while some of the unused fuel assemblies were moved to the spent fuel pool of Unit 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/2014/1246703_5892.html |title=FUEL REMOVAL FROM UNIT 4 REACTOR BUILDING COMPLETED AT FUKUSHIMA DAIICHI |publisher=www.tepco.co.jp |accessdate=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 May, the temporary seawater cooling pump for Reactor 5 stopped, which was discovered by TEPCO at 21 local time. At that time, the temperature in the reactor was 68&amp;nbsp;°C, and in the spent fuel pool 41&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-05/29/c_13899496.htm |title=Cooling system stops at No.5 reactor in Fukushima |publisher=Xinhua News |date=29 May 2011 |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 11 in the morning the following day the temperatures had risen to 92.2&amp;nbsp;°C and 45.7&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="JAIF96"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1306659230P.pdf |title=Earthquake News No. 96 |publisher=JAIF |date=29 May 2011 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011175026/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1306659230P.pdf |archivedate=11 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooling was restored at 12:49{{nbsp}}pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/11052908-e.html |title=Status of TEPCO's Facilities and its services after the Tohoku-Chihou-Taiheiyou-Oki Earthquake(as of 4:00 PM, 29 May) |publisher=TEPCO |date=29 May 2011 |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 June TEPCO completed repairs to the Reactor Building Equipment Cooling Water system of Unit 5 which removes heat from the main Fuel Pool Cooling and Clean-up system as well as other equipment. The fuel pool and reactor core are now being cooled simultaneously, the fuel pool by the Fuel Pool Cooling System and Equipment Cooling Water System and the reactor core by the Residual Heat Removal System. Previously the Residual Heat Removal System was alternately being switched between cooling the reactor core and fuel pool. On 16 September, the same was accomplished in Unit 6 and now the reactors and storage pools of both units are being cooled separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nisa.meti.go.jp/english/press/2011/07/en20110715-1-2.pdf |title=Conditions of Fukushima Daiichi Unit 5 |publisher=NISA |date=17 July 2011 |accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 July in the morning, a crack in a polyvinyl hose - 30 centimeters long and 7 centimeters wide - was found around the outlet of a temporary pump for seawater. At 10{{nbsp}}am the pump was shut off, the cooling system of reactor 5 was halted 15 minutes later. The polyvinyl pipe was replaced, and the cooling system was restarted at 1:45{{nbsp}}pm. The temperature in the reactor rose some 5 degrees Celsius to 47.7 degrees Celsius. Constant tidal movements were probably the cause of the rupture of the pleated flexible tube.&lt;ref&gt;''NHK-world'' (3 July 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/03_16.html Cooling resumes at Fukushima No.5 reactor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828100923/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/03_16.html |date=28 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 July TEPCO announced that all tubes and hoses used in the heat removal systems will be checked on possible weaknesses. Tubes like these, that were used to transfer highly radioactive water, did not require replacement because they were not bent at extreme angles.&lt;ref&gt;''JAIF''[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1309749703P.pdf Hoses at Fukushima to be checked] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011182036/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1309749703P.pdf |date=11 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At 10:16{{nbsp}}am on 15 July, TEPCO completed repairs to Pump B of the original Residual Heat Removal Seawater System of Unit 5. The original seawater system was severely damaged in the tsunami requiring the temporary seawater pumps and hoses to be installed which have proven to be leak prone. At 2:45{{nbsp}}pm on 15 July, TEPCO began pumping seawater through the residual heat removal heat exchanger with the newly repaired pump.&lt;ref&gt;''TEPCO'' (17 July 2011) [http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/11071707-e.html Plant Status of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station (as of 3:00 pm, 17 July)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tsunami]] that followed the earthquake and inundated the plant was initially estimated by TEPCO to be 14 meters high, which would have been more than twice the designed height.&lt;ref name=WNN24/&gt;
Other sources give the tsunami height at Fukushima Daini plant at 9-meter-high, while the Fukushima Daiichi plant was hit by a 13-meter-high tsunami.
The tsunami caused the plant's seawater pumps, used to cool reactors, to fail. 
Of the plant's four reactors, three were in danger of meltdown.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yomiuri Shimbun]] 2012-02-09 Ver.13S page 1&amp;2, [http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T120209007089.htm Fukushima No. 2 plant was 'near meltdown']&lt;/ref&gt; 
One external high-voltage power line still functioned, allowing plant staff in the central control room to monitor data on internal reactor temperatures and water levels. 
2,000 employees of the plant worked to stabilize the reactors. 
Some employees connected over 9 kilometers of cabling using 200-meter sections of cable, each weighing more than a ton from their Rad Waste Building to other locations onsite.

The steam powered [[reactor core isolation cooling system]] (RCIC) in all 4 units was activated and ran as needed to maintain water level. 
At the same time, operators utilized the safety relief valve systems to keep the reactor pressures from getting too high by dumping the heat to the suppression pools.&lt;ref name=WNN18/&gt; 
In unit 3, one seawater pump remained operational and the residual heat removal system (RHR) was started to cool the suppression pool and later brought the reactor to cold shutdown on March 12. 
In units 1, 2, and 4 heat removal was unavailable, so the suppression pools began heating up and on March 12, the water temperature in the pools of units 1, 2, and 4 reached 100&amp;nbsp;°C between 05:30 and 06:10 [[Japan Standard Time|JST]],&lt;ref name=WNN14/&gt;&lt;ref name=tepco3&gt;reports for [http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/11031212-e.html reactor 1], [http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/11031213-e.html reactor 2], and [http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/11031214-e.html reactor 4] of Tokyo Electric, received 11:50 JST&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winter, Michael [http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2011/03/cooling-fails-at-3-reactors-at-another-japanese-nuke-plant/1 "Cooling system fails at 3 reactors at another Japanese nuclear plant"] USA Today, March 11, 2011, 6:01 EST.&lt;/ref&gt; removing the ability to remove pressure from the reactor and drywell.&lt;ref name=WNN18/&gt;

Operators had to also prepare an alternate injection line for each unit, as the RCIC can run indefinitely only while there is sufficient pressure and steam in the reactor to drive its turbine. 
Once the reactor pressure drops below a certain level, the RCIC shuts down automatically. 
The normal electrically driven [[Nuclear reactor safety system|Emergency Core Cooling Systems]] (ECCS) were for the most part unavailable due to the loss of the ultimate heat sink and damage to some of the electrical infrastructure. 
Operators prepared for this and set up an alternate injection line using a non-emergency system known as the ''Makeup Water Condensate'' (MUWC) system to maintain water level which was an accident mitigation method TEPCO put in place at all its nuclear plants.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
The system was started and stopped in all 4 units, including unit 3, as needed to maintain the water level. 
The RCICs in each unit later shut down due to low reactor pressure.{{when|date=October 2017}}{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} 
The MUWC and the ''makeup water purification and filtering'' (MUPF) systems were also used to try to cool the suppression pool and drywell in addition to the reactor to prevent the drywell pressure from getting too high. 
Operators were later able to restore the High Pressure Core Spray portion of the ECCS in unit 4 and switched emergency water injection for unit 4 from the MUWC system to the HPCS.

While the water level was maintained in the three cores using emergency water injection, pressures in the containment vessel continued to rise due to lack of suppression pool cooling and the operators prepared to vent the containments making restoration of heat removal urgent.{{clarify|date=October 2017}} 
Unit 1 was prioritized as it had the highest drywell pressure.&lt;ref name="chronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/betu11_e/images/110810e22.pdf|title=Chronology of Events at Fukushima Daini nuclear power station|publisher=TEPCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cold shutdown====
The ultimate heat sink was restored on March 13 when the service seawater system pumps in the pump room were repaired in units 1, 2 and 4. 
This allowed to restore the normal ECCS and heat removal systems to operable status and cooling was switched to the ''Residual Heat Removal System'' (RHR) portion of the ECCS. 
The RHR systems were first activated to cool down the suppression pools (torus) and drywells to operable status, and water injections were made to the reactors using the ''Low Pressure Coolant Injection'' (LPCI) mode as needed. 
When the suppression pool was cooled down to below 100&amp;nbsp;°C, the RHR was switched to the shutdown cooling mode and brought the reactors to a cold shutdown.&lt;ref name=WNN14/&gt;

Coolant temperatures below 100&amp;nbsp;°C ([[cold shutdown]]) were reached in reactor 2 about 34 hours after the emergency shut down ([[scram]]).&lt;ref name=WNN14&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS_Cold_shutdowns_at_Fukushima_Daini_1403112.html |title=Cold shutdowns at Fukushima Daini |date=March 14, 2011 |publisher=World Nuclear News |accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These zones were later superseded by the 20&amp;nbsp;km evacuation and 30&amp;nbsp;km no-fly zones around Fukushima Daiichi on March 12 and 15, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://centreforaviation.com/analysis/japan-invokes-30-km-no-fly-zone-around-fukushima-plant-more-flights-to-northeast---update-4-47836 Japan invokes 30km no-fly zone around Fukushima plant; more flights to north-east - Update 4 | CAPA]. Centre for Aviation. Retrieved on 2013-09-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|June 2011}}, 7,000 tons of seawater from the tsunami remained in the plant. 
The plant planned to release it all back into the ocean, as the tanks and structures holding the water were beginning to corrode.
Approximately 3,000 tons of the water was found to contain radioactive substances, and Japan's Fisheries Agency refused permission to release that water back into the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110609a1.html Fishermen to Tepco: Don't release water]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', June 9, 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Restoration ====
On December 26, 2011, the Prime Minister officially cancelled the nuclear emergency declaration for the Fukushima Daini plant officially ending the incident.
On February 8, 2012, the plant was opened to news media for the first time since the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]].

The evacuation order was partly rescinded for Daini evacuees in August 2012. Some of the residents, such as the 7200 at [[Naraha, Fukushima|Naraha]], were permitted to return during daylight hours only, but others were ordered to remain away. The area did not become seriously contaminated and was safe to visit without protective clothing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/rs-restoration_plans_for_fukushima_area-0409124.html Restoration plans for Fukushima area].

Retrieved on 2013-09-06.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the evacuation order for Naraha was completely lifted, allowing residents to return and reconstruction efforts to begin. Naraha is the first of a number of towns in the area to have had its evacuation order removed.

===2016 earthquake===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3186">{{Nihongo|'''Genpatsu-shinsai'''|原発震災}}, meaning ''nuclear power plant earthquake disaster'' (from the two words ''Genpatsu'' – nuclear power plant – and ''Shinsai'' – earthquake disaster) is a term which was coined by Japanese [[Seismology|seismologist]] Professor [[Katsuhiko Ishibashi]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=ishibashi-slides-2003&gt;[http://historical.seismology.jp/ishibashi/opinion/0307IUGG_slides.pdf Genpatsu-Shinsai: Catastrophic Multiple Disaster of Earthquake and Quake-induced Nuclear Accident Anticipated in the Japanese Islands (Slides)], [[Katsuhiko Ishibashi]], 23rd. General Assembly of IUGG, 2003, Sapporo, Japan, accessed 2011-03-28&lt;/ref&gt; It describes a [[domino effect]] scenario in which a major [[earthquake]] causes a severe accident at a [[nuclear power plant]] near a major population centre, resulting in an uncontrollable release of radiation in which the radiation levels make damage control and rescue impossible, and earthquake damage severely impedes the evacuation of the population. Ishibashi envisages that such an event would have a global impact and a 'fatal' effect on Japan, seriously affecting future generations.&lt;ref name=ishibashi-slides-2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ishibashi-abstract-2003&gt;[http://historical.seismology.jp/ishibashi/opinion/0307IUGG_Genpatsu_Abstract.pdf Genpatsu-Shinsai: Catastrophic Multiple Disaster of Earthquake and Quake-induced Nuclear Accident Anticipated in the Japanese Islands (Abstract)], [[Katsuhiko Ishibashi]], 23rd. General Assembly of IUGG, 2003, Sapporo, Japan, accessed 2011-03-28&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, Ishibashi believes that a number of nuclear power stations could be involved in such a scenario, but that the [[Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant]], located near the centre of the expected [[Tōkai earthquake]]s, is the most likely candidate. He is also concerned that a similar scenario could take place elsewhere in the world. As a result, he believes that the matter should be a global concern.&lt;ref name=ishibashi-slides-2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ishibashi-abstract-2003 /&gt;

===The Committee===
The Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations (ICANPS) was tasked with: ''"conducting an investigation to determine the causes of the accident that occurred at Fukushima Daiichi and Daini Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company, and those of the damages generated by the accident, and thereby making policy proposals designed to prevent the expansion of the damages and the recurrence of similar accidents in the future"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official website of the Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company |url=http://icanps.go.jp/eng/ |accessdate=29 July 2012 |quote=This committee was established with the aim of conducting an investigation to determine the causes of the accident that occurred at Fukushima Daiichi and Daini Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company, and those of the damages generated by the accident, and thereby making policy proposals designed to prevent the expansion of the damages and the recurrence of similar accidents in the future. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60axydhPx?url=http://icanps.go.jp/eng/ |archivedate=31 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 10 member,&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120723"&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan nuclear plants 'still not safe'|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2012/07/20127236623434937.html|publisher=Al Jazeera Online|accessdate=29 July 2012|date=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; government-appointed panel included scholars, journalists, lawyers and engineers,&lt;ref name="NTI20120723" /&gt; was supported by public prosecutors and government experts&lt;ref name="WSJ20120723"&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan Panel Says Plant Operator Falls Short on Nuclear Safety|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444025204577544732979462706 |accessdate=30 July 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=23 July 2012|author=Mitsuru Obe and Eleanor Warnock}}&lt;/ref&gt; interviewed  772 people,&lt;ref name="BBW20120723" /&gt; including plant workers, government officials and evacuees,&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi20120723" /&gt; for a total of nearly 1,479 hearing hours&lt;ref name="BBW20120723" /&gt; - and released its final 448-page&lt;ref name="BBW20120723"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fukushima Investigators Say More Study Needed on What Went Wrong|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-07-23/fukushima-investigators-say-more-study-needed-on-what-went-wrong|accessdate=29 July 2012|newspaper=Bloomsberg Businessweek|date=23 July 2012|author=Tsuyoshi Inajima and Yuji Okada}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigation report on July 23, 2012.&lt;ref name="CNN20120723"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hancocks|first=Paula|title=New report criticizes TEPCO over Fukushima nuclear crisis|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/23/world/asia/japan-fukushima-report/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=29 July 2012|date=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Asahi20120723"&gt;{{cite news|title=UPDATE: Government panel blasts lack of 'safety culture' in nuclear accident |url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201207230081 |accessdate=29 July 2012 |newspaper=The [[Asahi Shimbun]] |date=23 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413220232/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201207230081 |archivedate=13 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its report was the fourth investigation into the crisis after the earlier release of a parliamentary study, a private report by journalists and academics as well as an investigation by TEPCO.&lt;ref name="ANN20120723"&gt;{{cite web|last=Willacy|first=Mark|title=New report says Japan ignored nuclear safety risks|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-07-23/an-fukushima-report/4148874|publisher=Australia Network News|accessdate=29 July 2012|date=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Interim investigation report===
For [http://icanps.go.jp/eng/interim-report.html the interim report issued on December 26, 2011], the committee interviewed 456 people over a total of 900 hours of hearings by Dec. 16, 2011.  The interim report was "a scathing assessment of the response to the Fukushima disaster", in which the investigative panel "blamed the central government and the Tokyo Electric Power Co., saying both seemed incapable of making decisions to stem radiation leaks as the situation at the coastal plant worsened in the days and weeks after the disaster".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2011/12/a-new-study-released-today-said-that-theregulatory-fallout-from-the-fukushima-power-plantdisaster-in-japan-last-marchwill-pro.html |title=Report: U.S. nuclear renaissance unlikely after Fukushima |author= |date=December 28, 2011 |work=LA Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; It attaches blame to Japan's central government as well as Tokyo Electric Power Co., "depicting a scene of harried officials incapable of making decisions to stem radiation leaks as the situation at the coastal plant worsened in the days and weeks following the disaster".&lt;ref name=yotaro2011/&gt; The 507-page interim report, said Japan's response to the crisis at Fukushima Daiichi was flawed by "poor communication and delays in releasing data on dangerous radiation leaks at the facility", and poor planning also worsened the disaster response, noting that authorities had "grossly underestimated tsunami risks" that followed the magnitude 9.0 earthquake. The 15m (40-foot) high tsunami that struck the plant was twice as tall as the highest wave predicted by officials, and the erroneous assumption that the plant's cooling system continued to work after the tsunami struck worsened the disaster. "Plant workers had no clear instructions on how to respond to such a disaster, causing miscommunication, especially when the disaster destroyed backup generators. Ultimately, the series of failures led to the worst nuclear catastrophe since Chernobyl".&lt;ref name=yotaro2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2011/12/japans-march-11-earthquake-and-tsunami-fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-power-plant-meltdown.html |title=Report: Japan, utility at fault for response to nuclear disaster |author= |date=December 26, 2011 |work=LA Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report concluded “It's inexcusable that a nuclear accident couldn't be managed because a major event such as the tsunami exceeded expectations.”&lt;ref name=BW01&gt;[http://news.businessweek.com/article.asp?documentKey=1376-LWSRLN1A1I4H01-73QTPPK5C1TSH942F3ITTFH13N "Fukushima Probe Puts Regulator, Cellphones on List of Failures"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109051325/http://news.businessweek.com/article.asp?documentKey=1376-LWSRLN1A1I4H01-73QTPPK5C1TSH942F3ITTFH13N |date=2012-01-09 }}, ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'', December 27, 2011.

===Final investigation report===


The panel said the government and TEPCO failed to prevent the disaster not because a large tsunami was unanticipated, but because they were reluctant to invest time, effort and money in protecting against a natural disaster considered unlikely.&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi20120723" /&gt; "The utility and regulatory bodies were overly confident that events beyond the scope of their assumptions would not occur . . . and were not aware that measures to avoid the worst situation were actually full of holes," the government panel said in its final report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wallace|first=Rick|title=Fukushima crushed by 'myth', says panel|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/fukushima-crushed-by-myth-says-panel/story-e6frg6so-1226433149824|accessdate=30 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Australian]]|date=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; TEPCO had even weighed in on a report about earthquake risk and asked the government to play down the likelihood of a tsunami in the region, the report said.&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi20120723"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fukushima Nuclear Disaster Report: Plant Operators Tokyo Electric And Government Still Stumbling|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/23/fukushima-dai-ichi-nuclear-plant-operators_n_1694476.html|work=The Associated Press|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=29 July 2012|author=Mari Yamaguchi|date=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panel's report faulted an inadequate legal system for nuclear crisis management, a crisis-command disarray caused by the government and Tepco, and possible excess meddling on the part of the prime minister's office in the early stage of the crisis.&lt;ref name="JapanTimes20120724" /&gt; The panel concluded that a culture of complacency about nuclear safety and poor crisis management led to the nuclear disaster.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120723" /&gt; 

The report stated that measures taken by TEPCO and the Japanese nuclear regulator to prepare the Fukushima nuclear plant for earthquakes and tsunamies were "insufficient" and their response to the  Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster was "inadequate."&lt;ref name="CNN20120723" /&gt; "Preparedness for a large-scale complex disaster was insufficient; and they were unprepared for the release of a large amount of radioactive materials into the environment caused by a containment failure," noted the report with respect to TEPCO and the Japanese [[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency]].&lt;ref name="NTI20120723"&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan, TEPCO ignored atomic accident risks due to 'myth of nuclear safety': Report|url=http://www.newstrackindia.com/newsdetails/2012/07/23/330-Japan-TEPCO-ignored-atomic-accident-risks-due-to-myth-of-nuclear-safety-Report.html|work=[[Asian News International]] (ANI)|publisher=News Track India|accessdate=29 July 2012|date=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It noted for example that Fukushima staff was poorly trained to deal with the crisis after the plant's reactors went into meltdown.&lt;ref name="NTI20120723" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JapanTimes20120724" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MainichiShimbun20120723" /&gt; TEPCO did not adequately train employees "to think independently and to act, and lacked flexible and proactive thinking required for crisis response", the report said.&lt;ref name=BangkokPost20120723 /&gt; Tepco was criticized by the panel for failing to give most workers dosimeters that would have kept track of their exposure to harmful radiation as they fought to contain meltdowns in the early days of the crisis. While Tepco had access to hundreds of dosimeters sent from other nuclear power plants across Japan, managers of the company failed to put them to use — a sign that the company paid little heed to worker safety, the report said.&lt;ref name="NYT20120723"&gt;{{cite news|title=Inquiry Sees Chaos in Evacuations After Japan Tsunami|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/24/world/asia/inquiry-sees-chaos-in-evacuations-after-japan-tsunami.html?_r=3|accessdate=30 July 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 July 2012|author=Hiroko Tabuchi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of poor communication among Fukushima officials, the police and Japanese Self-Defense Forces personnel, the evacuation of Futaba hospital and its nearby health care facility for the elderly, located just 5&amp;nbsp;km from the damaged plant, was delayed.&lt;ref name="JapanTimes20120724" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT20120723" /&gt; Residents living around the Fukushima plant may also have been able to keep exposure to minimum if the government had effectively used a computer system to predict the spread of radioactive materials, even though data on the damaged reactors were not available.&lt;ref name="MainichiShimbun20120723" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT20120723" /&gt;

Besides a failure of disaster management and risk analysis, TEPCO lacks “sufficient enthusiasm to fully investigate the Fukushima disaster and learn lessons to prevent recurrence even more than one year after the accident,” the report said.&lt;ref name="BBW20120723" /&gt; The investigators of the panel said TEPCO has to address problems within its own culture that contributed to its failings in the crisis, including employees “not fully trained to think for themselves.”&lt;ref name="WP20120723" /&gt; “We still don’t perceive much enthusiasm in the accident investigation from” the company, the report said. “TEPCO must take our findings sincerely and resolve the problems to achieve a higher level of safety culture across the company.”&lt;ref name="WP20120723"&gt;{{cite web|title=Operator of Japan’s crippled nuke plant still mishandling disaster response, investigators say|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/govt-appointed-panel-criticizes-tepco-for-dragging-feet-in-probe-into-japan-nuclear-disaster/2012/07/23/gJQAzulW3W_story.html|work=The Associated Press|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=29 July 2012|date=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICANPS report also said interference by then Japan prime minister Naoto Kan at the time of the disaster created confusion in the response to the crisis.&lt;ref name="CNN20120723" /&gt; "It must be said that more harm was done (than good) as his involvement ... could have confused the scene, potentially missing opportunities to make important judgments and creating opportunities for misjudgments," the report said.&lt;ref name=BangkokPost20120723&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan, TEPCO 'ignored' nuke risk|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/303862/japan-tepco-ignored-nuclear-accident-risks-report|accessdate=29 July 2012|newspaper=The Bangkok Post|date=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kan's office was criticized by the ICANPS panel for controlling information, delaying crucial announcements to the public and overly softening expressions about the severity of the accident, causing confusion, threats to health and public distrust in the government.&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi20120723" /&gt; 

Japanese officials ignored the risks of an atomic accident because they believed in the 'myth of nuclear safety'.,&lt;ref name="NTI20120723" /&gt; i.e. the notion that severe accidents don't happen at nuclear power plants in Japan.&lt;ref name="ANN20120723" /&gt; "The fundamental problem lies in the fact that utilities, including Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO), and the government failed to see the danger as reality," the report said. It also said that they were under the 'notion that severe accidents do not happen at nuclear plants in our country'.&lt;ref name="NTI20120723" /&gt; "Because the government and the power utilities, including Tepco, were biased by the safety myth, thinking they would never ever face such a serious accident, they were unable to realize that such a crisis could occur in reality. This appears to be the fundamental problem," the panel said in its final report.&lt;ref name="JapanTimes20120724"&gt;{{cite news|title=Government, Tepco again hit for nuke crisis|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120724a1.html|accessdate=29 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Japan Times]]|date=24 July 2012|author=Kazuaki Nagata}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tepco thus failed to prepare adequate tsunami defenses or crisis management procedures to deal with a station blackout, the panel's report said.&lt;ref name="JapanTimes20120724" /&gt; "The Fukushima crisis occurred because people didn't take the impact of natural disasters so seriously," University of Tokyo engineering professor Yotaro Hatamura, who chaired the commission, told a news conference. "Even though there were new findings (about the risk of a tsunami), Tepco couldn't see it because people are blind to what they don't want to see."&lt;ref name="Reuters2012072"&gt;{{cite web|title=UPDATE 2-Japan Fukushima probe urges new disaster prevention steps, mindset|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/07/23/japan-nuclear-idINL4E8IN4NN20120723|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=29 July 2012|author=Risa Maeda|date=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nuclear regulators did not pay sufficient attention to improvements in nuclear safety standards as recommended by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) and the Japanese Nuclear Industrial and Safety Agency had been promoting nuclear energy without being open about the inherent risks.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120723" /&gt; According to the report, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency strongly opposed a plan in 2006 to enhance preparedness against a nuclear disaster, fearing such a move would raise concerns about the safety of nuclear power among residents living near atomic plants.&lt;ref name="MainichiShimbun20120723" /&gt; The failure of the central and local governments to consider the possibility of a nuclear accident caused by multiple factors such as earthquakes and tsunami also caused a delay in responding to the accident. According to the report there was an insufficient crisis management structure for ensuring the safety of local communities.&lt;ref name="Asahi20120723" /&gt; The Japanese government failed to give a detailed announcement about what was happening and how it might affect people living nearby, while the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency was reluctant to inform the media that reactor 1's fuel rods possibly melted, although it knew that was quite likely.&lt;ref name="JapanTimes20120724" /&gt; 

The panel suggested that post-Fukushima safety steps taken at nuclear power plants across the country have not been enough to cope with a complex catastrophe. "We understand that immediate safety measures are being further detailed and will materialise in the future. But we strongly urge the people concerned to make continued efforts to take really effective steps," said the panel, chaired by University of Tokyo engineering professor Yotaro Hatamura.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120723" /&gt; "Both the government and companies should establish a new philosophy of disaster prevention that requires safety and disaster measures against any massive accident and disaster... regardless of event probability," the report said.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120723" /&gt;

The report criticized TEPCO's argument that the nuclear accident was due to a tsunami of an unimaginable, unpredictable scale.&lt;ref name="MainichiShimbun20120723"&gt;{{cite news|title=TEPCO mishandled nuclear crisis, 'overly confident' of safety: gov't panel|url=http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120723p2g00m0dm081000c.html|accessdate=30 July 2012|newspaper=The [[Mainichi Shimbun]]|date=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It stated, "The reason the accident was beyond assumptions was because no attempt was made to make assumptions due to a safety myth that had no basis in fact." The ICANPS panel said that there was no proof that the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake]] was a key factor in the disaster, but added that a certain degree of impact could not be ruled out.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120723" /&gt; Many scientists and activists have disputed the Japanese government and TEPCO's findings that the plant's cooling systems were knocked out by giant waves that slammed into the plant, suggesting it was the initial earthquake that damaged the reactors.&lt;ref name=BangkokPost20120723 /&gt; TEPCO's own investigation put the blame for the accident solely on the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|tsunami]].&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120723" /&gt; The panel, however, called on TEPCO to review data that had been presented to it, saying that it believed that it contained errors.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120723" /&gt; It also said TEPCO covered up unfavourable data in a computer analysis attempting to measure the extent of damage inside the reactors.&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi20120723" /&gt;

Commission chairman Yotaro Hatamura said that due to time restrictions, his panel was unable to address the concerns of residents, and the international community, who questioned whether the damaged reactors and the pool of used nuclear fuel at Fukushima's No.4 reactor could withstand another earthquake. "I now understand what people are worried the most about is the vulnerability of the No.4 spent fuel pool. I wish we had started an investigation on it much earlier," Hatamura said.&lt;ref name="Reuters2012072" /&gt;

Based on the lessons learned from the accident, the panel proposed the government and utilities take safety steps regardless of the probability of tsunami and other events that could have a potentially strong impact, and review disaster reduction measures when important new findings are revealed.&lt;ref name="MainichiShimbun20120723" /&gt; The final report included seven recommendations for preventing a recurrence of the Fukushima nuclear accident, such as safety measures and ways to prevent the spreading of damage.&lt;ref name="Asahi20120723" /&gt; The panel didn't recommend charges against any of those involved in the  Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final report criticises weak Fukushima response|url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2012-07-23/final-report-criticises-weak-fukushima-response/985054|work=ABC/Agence France Presse|publisher=Radio Australia|accessdate=29 July 2012|date=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the panel called on the government to take immediate action on certain issues, such as ensuring off-site nuclear accident management centres are protected against the kind of massive radiation leaks that rendered the one at Fukushima unusable.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120723" /&gt; It recommended that all nuclear operators in Japan conduct a comprehensive risk analysis of their facilities&lt;ref name="CNN20120723" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fukushima probe delivers damning verdict|url=http://www.euronews.com/2012/07/23/fukushima-probe-delivers-damning-verdict/|work=Euronews|publisher=Euronews|accessdate=29 July 2012|date=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and urged the Japanese government and TEPCO to conduct further investigations to fully disclose the cause of the  Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan panel blames Fukushima plant operator, nuclear regulators|url=http://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2254224&amp;language=en|work=Kuwait News Agengcy|publisher=Kuwait News Agengcy|accessdate=29 July 2012|date=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; because there are many unresolved issues, such as the process by which radioactive materials leaked out of the Fukushima No. 1 plant.&lt;ref name="Asahi20120723" /&gt; “The government shouldn’t close its accident investigation into Fukushima with the end of probes by our committee and the [[w:National Diet of Japan Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission|parliamentary commission]],” Hatamura’s panel reported. “When radiation levels fall, detailed on-site examination inside reactor buildings, including examination of quake effects, must be carried out.”&lt;ref name="BBW20120723" /&gt;

== Introduction ==
In Japan, the [[Great East Japan Earthquake|2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake]] occurred at 14:46 on 11 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;This name of the earthquake is chosen by [[Japan Meteorological Agency|Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA)]]. 
By a cabinet decision, the Japanese government has approved the use of expression "Great East Japan Earthquake" in reference to the disaster, including the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], caused by this earthquake. [[#ICANPS(2011)|ICANPS(2011)]] p.19
&lt;/ref&gt;
At the [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station]] (Fukushima Daiichi NPS),&lt;ref&gt;The power station has six [[boiling water reactor]]s (BWRs) originally designed by [[General Electric]] (GE) and [[Toshiba]].
&lt;/ref&gt; operated by the [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]] (TEPCO), 
the earthquake and tsunami caused the compound accident (hereinafter called Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident) consisting of '''Station BlackOut''' (SBO) incident,
Unit [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (Unit 1 Reactor)|1]],
[[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (Unit 2 Reactor)|2]],
[[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (Unit 3 Reactor)|3]] severe core damage accidents, Unit 1, 2, 4 hydrogen explosion accidents,
radioactive releases&lt;ref&gt;
The Japanese government estimates the total amount of radioactivity released into the atmosphere was approximately one-tenth as much as was released during the Chernobyl disaster.

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In May 2012, TEPCO reported that at least 900 [[Petabecquerel|PBq]] had been released "into the atmosphere in March last year [2011] alone" although it has been said staff may have been told to lie, and give false readings to try and cover up true levels of radiation.

&lt;/ref&gt; and so on.&lt;ref&gt;
The accident was initially assessed by Japanese officials as Level 4 on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]] (INES). 
Later, the level was raised to 5 and eventually to 7, the maximum scale value.

&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the early events of this accident, Japanese government declared a nuclear emergency situation and established the '''Nuclear Emergency Response Headquarters''' (NERHQ), which instructed the Fukushima Prefectural Governor and relevant local governments to issue an evacuation order to citizens from the nearby Fukushima Daiichi NPS.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ICANPS(2011)|ICANPS(2011)]] p.303
&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant amounts of radioactive material have also been released into ground and ocean waters. Measurements taken by the Japanese government 30–50&amp;nbsp;km from the plant showed [[caesium-137]] levels high enough to cause concern, leading the government to ban the sale of food grown in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/19/us-japan-nuclear-food-idUSTRE72I1X120110319 Japan mulls Fukushima food ban: IAEA], Reuters, 19 March 2011  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5xJGKu1SX?url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/19/us-japan-nuclear-food-idUSTRE72I1X120110319 |date=19 March 2011 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kevin Krolicki" /&gt;

A few of the plant's workers were severely injured or killed by the disaster conditions resulting from the earthquake. There were no immediate deaths due to direct radiation exposures, but at least six workers have exceeded lifetime legal limits for radiation and more than 300 have received significant radiation doses. Predicted future cancer deaths due to accumulated radiation exposures in the population living near Fukushima have ranged from none&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=NPR|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=148227596|date=2012-03-09|accessdate=2012-04-15|title=Trauma, Not Radiation, Is Key Concern In Japan| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140309033042/http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=148227596 | archivedate = 2014-03-09| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 100&lt;ref name="Caracappa-ANS" /&gt; to a non-peer-reviewed "guesstimate"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/ombudsman/2012/03/15/148703963/the-cost-of-fear-the-framing-of-a-fukushima-report|date=2012-03-15|accessdate=2012-04-15|title=The Cost of Fear: The Framing of a Fukushima Report| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140505174012/http://www.npr.org/blogs/ombudsman/2012/03/15/148703963/the-cost-of-fear-the-framing-of-a-fukushima-report | archivedate = 2014-05-05| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 1,000. On 16 December 2011, Japanese authorities declared the plant to be stable, although it would take decades to decontaminate the surrounding areas and to decommission the plant altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan PM says Fukushima nuclear site finally stabilised|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16212057|work=BBC Online|accessdate=7 January 2012|date=16 December 2011| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140220102647/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16212057 | archivedate = 2014-02-20| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A process overview of the accident ===
At the Fukushima Daiichi NPS, all the off-site power supply was lost due to the earthquake.
Later, the subsequent arrival of the tsunami caused flooding of many cooling seawater pumps, emergency diesel generators (EDGs), and power panels which were housed in low-lying rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining Units 1-3 [[shutdown (nuclear reactor)|shutdown]] automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. &lt;br /&gt;
By the way, Units 1-3 were operating at the time of the accident; Units 4, 5 and 6 were in planned shutdown. [[#IAEA(2015)|IAEA(2015)]] p.1
&lt;/ref&gt;
This resulted in the total loss of AC power at Unit1 through 5.
As [[nuclear reactor coolant]] systems stopped for a long time from cutting power, the [[Decay heat#Power reactors in shutdown|reactors overheated]] due to the normal high radioactive [[decay heat]] produced&lt;ref&gt;smaller amounts of this heat normally continue to be released for years, but are not enough to cause fuel melting.
&lt;/ref&gt; in the first few days after nuclear reactor shutdown.&lt;ref&gt;F. Tanabe, Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology, 2011, volume 48, issue 8, pages 1135 to 1139&lt;/ref&gt;

As the water boiled away in the reactors and the water levels in the [[Spent nuclear fuel|fuel]] rod pools dropped, the reactor fuel rods began to overheat severely, and to melt down. In the hours and days that followed, Reactors 1, 2 and 3 experienced full [[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/06/06/japan.nuclear.meltdown/index.html?iref=NS1 |title=3 nuclear reactors melted down after quake, Japan confirms |work=CNN|date= 7 June 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140414115531/http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/06/06/japan.nuclear.meltdown/index.html?iref=NS1 | archivedate = 2014-04-14| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T110607005367.htm |title='Melt-through' at Fukushima? / Govt report to IAEA suggests situation worse than meltdown |work=Yomiuri |date=8 June 2011 |accessdate=8 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zSkWxIIC?url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T110607005367.htm |archivedate=15 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. As workers struggled to cool and shut down the reactors, several [[Hydrogen safety|hydrogen-air]] chemical explosions occurred.&lt;ref name="IAEA15March"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyer.eu/news/regional-news/hydrogen-in-nuclear-accidents-what-is-the-role-of-the-gas-in-fukushima Hydrogen explosions Fukushima nuclear plant: what happened?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235552/http://www.hyer.eu/news/regional-news/hydrogen-in-nuclear-accidents-what-is-the-role-of-the-gas-in-fukushima |date=2 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation Groups==
; National Diet of Japan Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission
The [[National Diet of Japan Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission]] (NAIIC) was established by the [[National Diet|National Diet of Japan]] as the first independent investigation commission on 8 December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;A profile description in the [http://warp.da.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/3856371/naiic.go.jp/en/ NAIIC] top page.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 July 2012, NAIIC released an executive summary report&lt;ref&gt;[[#NAIIC_summary(2012)|NAIIC_summary(2012)]]
&lt;/ref&gt; of The Fukushima Nuclear Accident. The panel is due to deliver its final report at the end of July.&lt;ref name="Wakatsuki"/&gt;

; Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company
The [[Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company]] (ICANPS) was established by the Cabinet decision on 24 May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ICANPS_summary(2011)|ICANPS_summary(2011)]] p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December 2011, ICANPS issued an interim report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2011/12/a-new-study-released-today-said-that-theregulatory-fallout-from-the-fukushima-power-plantdisaster-in-japan-last-marchwill-pro.html |title=Report: U.S. nuclear renaissance unlikely after Fukushima |date=28 December 2011 |work=LA Times | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140124025906/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2011/12/a-new-study-released-today-said-that-theregulatory-fallout-from-the-fukushima-power-plantdisaster-in-japan-last-marchwill-pro.html | archivedate = 2014-01-24| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 July 2012, the government appointed the committee submitted its final report to the Japanese government.&lt;ref name="Asahi20120723" /&gt;

; TEPCO Internal Investigation
On 20 June 2012, TEPCO released its final internal investigation report. In the report, TEPCO complained that top politicians, including the prime minister, interfered with recovery efforts during the initial stages of the disaster by making specific requests that were out of touch with what was actually taking place at the plant. TEPCO concluded that the direct cause of the accident was the tsunami which knocked out the reactors' cooling system. TEPCO also admitted that it was at fault in not being prepared for the situation, but said that its workers did the best they could "amid unprecedented circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;Nagata, Kazuaki, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120621a3.html Tepco lashes prime minister's office]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 21 June 2012, p. 1 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101132556/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120621a3.html |date=1 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Timeline of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster#Friday.2C 12 October 2012|Tepco admitted for the first time on October 12, 2012]] that it had failed to take stronger measures to prevent disasters for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants.&lt;ref name="NYT20121012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|last=Sheldrick|first=Aaron|title=Fukushima operator must learn from mistakes, new adviser says|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/10/13/japan-nuclear-adviser-fukushima-idINDEE89C03220121013?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=13 October 2012|date=12 October 2012| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140309030940/http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/10/13/japan-nuclear-adviser-fukushima-idINDEE89C03220121013?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews | archivedate = 2014-03-09| deadurl=no}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi20121012" /&gt;

; Others
As part of the government inquiry, the [[House of Representatives of Japan]]'s special science committee directed TEPCO to submit to them its manuals and procedures for dealing with reactor accidents. TEPCO responded by submitting manuals with most of the text blotted out. In response, the [[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency]] ordered TEPCO to resubmit the manuals by 28 September 2011 without hiding any of the content. TEPCO replied that it would comply with the order.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jiji Press]], "Tepco must submit reactor accident manuals without deleted portions", ''Japan Times'', 28 September 2011, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October [[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency|NISA]] published a large portion of Tokyo Electric Power Company's procedural manuals for nuclear accidents. These were the manuals that the operator of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant earlier did send to the Lower House with most of the contents blacked out, saying that this information should be kept secret to protect its intellectual property rights, and that disclosure would offer information to possible terrorists. NISA ordered TEPCO to send the manuals without any redaction, as the law orders. 200 pages were released from the accident procedural manuals used for Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. All their contents were published, only the names of individuals were left out.&lt;ref&gt;
From these documents could be concluded:
* TEPCO did not make sufficient preparations to cope with critical nuclear accidents.
* After the batteries and power supply boards were inundated on 11 March, almost all electricity sources were lost
* TEPCO did not envision such a power failure or any kind of prolonged power loss.
* TEPCO thought that in a serious incident, venting pressure in the reactor containment vessels or carrying out other safety procedures would still be possible, because emergency power sources would still be available.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency said, the decision to publish the manuals was taken, for transparency in the search what caused the nuclear accident in Fukushima and also to establish better safety measures for the future.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (24 October 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/24_33.html Parts of TEPCO's accident manuals made public]. {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5zgtSnLOL?url=http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/24_33.html |date=24 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October 2011 the first meeting was held by a group of 6 nuclear energy specialists invited by [[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency|NISA]] to discuss the lessons to be learned from the accidents in Fukushima.&lt;ref&gt;
Their first remarks were:
* Japanese nuclear power plants should have multiple power sources
* plants should be able to maintain electricity during an earthquake or other emergencies
* TEPCO should examine why the equipment failed to work and should take appropriate actions to prevent such failures in the future
&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February 2012, the Independent Investigation Commission on the Fukushima Nuclear Accident by the Rebuild Japan Initiative Foundation announced an investigation report.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://rebuildjpn.org/en/project/fukushima/ The Independent Investigation Commission on the Fukushima Nuclear Accident]
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oregon]]'s [[United States Senator]] [[Ron Wyden]] toured the plant and issued a statement that the situation was "worse than reported." He sent a letter to Japanese Ambassador Ichiro Fujisaki urging Japan to seek international help to relocate spent fuel rods stored in unsound structures and prevent leakage of dangerous nuclear material.&lt;ref&gt;Phred Dvorak, [https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2012/04/17/fukushima-daiichis-achilles-heel-unit-4s-spent-fuel/ Fukushima Daiichi’s Achilles Heel: Unit 4′s Spent Fuel?], [[Wall Street Journal]], 17 April 2012. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312175237/https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2012/04/17/fukushima-daiichis-achilles-heel-unit-4s-spent-fuel/ |date=12 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/after-tour-of-fukushima-nuclear-power-station-wyden-says-situation-worse-than-reported After Tour of Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, Wyden Says Situation Worse than Reported], from Office of [[United States Senator]] [[Ron Wyden]], 16 April 2012. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404194624/http://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/after-tour-of-fukushima-nuclear-power-station-wyden-says-situation-worse-than-reported |date=4 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that because of this detected value, non-indispensable staff was evacuated from the plant, in line with the Emergency Response Plan, and that the population around the plant is already evacuated. |accessdate=16 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5x8gJ8rN2?url=http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/tsunamiupdate01.html |archivedate=12 March 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Atomic Energy Commission of Japan'''|原子力委員会|Genshiryokuiinkai}} was established in 1956 and serves as the regulatory body for [[nuclear power in Japan]].  The [[Atomic Energy Basic Law]] contained a provision for its creation, and shortly after the law was enacted, the organization started activities, which are stated to be: assure that research and use of [[nuclear power]] is conducted safely and with peaceful intentions, and construct plans for the use and development of nuclear power.  It is now structured with 5 different committee members as commission of inquiry to the [[Cabinet Office (Japan)|Cabinet Office]].

The AEC is located in [[Kasumigaseki]], [[Chiyoda, Tokyo]].

The Japanese reaction occurred after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. A nuclear emergency was declared by the [[government of Japan]] on 11 March. Later Prime Minister [[Naoto Kan]] issued instructions that people within a {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} zone around the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant]] must leave, and urged that those living between 20&amp;nbsp;km and 30&amp;nbsp;km from the site to stay indoors.&lt;ref name=BBC15&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Black |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12740843 |title=BBC News&amp;nbsp;– Japan quake: Radiation rises at Fukushima nuclear plant |publisher=BBC News |date= 15 March 2011|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rian15&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20110315/163008635.html |title=Japan's PM urges people to clear 20-km zone around Fukushima NPP (Update-1) &amp;#124; World &amp;#124; RIA Novosti |publisher=En.rian.ru |date= |accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter groups were also urged to evacuate on 25 March.&lt;ref name=evac/&gt;

Once a proponent of building more reactors, Prime Minister Naoto Kan took an increasingly [[anti-nuclear]] stance in the months following the Fukushima disaster. In May, he ordered the aging [[Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant]] be closed over earthquake and tsunami fears, and said he would freeze plans to build new reactors.

On 30 March the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) discovered 20&amp;nbsp;[[becquerel|MBq]]/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of Iodine-131 samples taken from 18 to 26 March in [[Iitate, Fukushima]], 40&amp;nbsp;km northwest of the Fukushima I reactor. The IAEA recommended expanding the evacuation area, based on its criteria of 10&amp;nbsp;MBq/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Japanese Secretary [[Yukio Edano]] stated the government would wait to see if the high radiation continued.&lt;ref&gt;Takahara, Kanako, and Kazuaki Nagata, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110401a1.html High radiation found outside no-go zone]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 1 April 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 March the IAEA announced a new value of 7&amp;nbsp;MBq/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, in samples taken from 19 to 29 March in Iitate.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110402x3.html&lt;/ref&gt; The material decays at 8% to 9% each day.

On 11 April, with ongoing concerns about the stability of the reactors, Japan considered extending the evacuation zone around the Fukushima I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/11/us-japan-idUSTRE72A0SS20110411?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews |title=Japan set to extend nuclear evacuation zone |author=Shinichi Saoshiro and Chisa Fujioka |date=April 10, 2011  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Then, on 21 April 2011, the Japanese government declared a 20-km zone around Daiichi as a "no-go" zone, and threatened anyone who entered or remained in the zone with arrest or detention and fines. The order affected 80,000 residents.&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]], "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110422a1.html No-go zone trespassers face fines, arrest]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 22 April 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-rare-look-at-the-fukushima-daiichi-no-go-zone/&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, on 22 April, the Japanese government officially announced that the evacuation zone would be extended from the 20&amp;nbsp;km "circular" zone to an irregular zone extending northwest of the Fukushima site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/22_20.html Evacuation area officially expanded] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511120445/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/22_20.html |date=2011-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, on 16 May, the Japanese government began evacuating people from outside the official exclusion zones, including the village of Iitate, where high levels of radiation had been repeatedly measured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/05/16/3217488.htm?section=world Japan evacuates villages outside nuclear zone]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110513f1.html Fukushima village on way to becoming ghost town]&lt;/ref&gt;

Evacuees from the radiation zone have reported that some evacuation shelters, including ones run by the city of [[Tsukuba, Ibaraki]], have refused to allow them entrance to their facilities, claiming that the evacuees could be carrying radioactive contamination with them.  The shelters have required the evacuees to present certificates obtained by the government of Fukushima prefecture stating that the evacuees are "radiation free".&lt;ref&gt;[[Agence France-Presse]]/[[Jiji Press]], "Atomic evacuees getting cold shoulder at shelters", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 16 April 2011, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jiji Press]], "Tsukuba asked evacuees for radiation papers", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 20 April 2011, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2011, more than 100,000 Fukushima Prefecture residents are still subject to a range of evacuation measures, forcing them to live outside their home cities and towns. Some locations near the crippled nuclear power plant are estimated to be contaminated with accumulated radiation doses of more than 500 millisieverts a year, diminishing residents' hopes of returning home anytime soon. Even areas away from the nuclear plant are still suffering from a sharp decline in tourism and sluggish financial conditions.&lt;ref name="mdn.mainichi.jp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110909p2a00m0na014000c.html |title=Over 100,000 Fukushima Prefecture residents can't return to hometowns |author= |date=September 9, 2011 |work=Mainichi Daily |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910225829/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110909p2a00m0na014000c.html |archivedate=September 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 23 February 2012, 62,674 Fukushima residents had evacuated from the prefecture.&lt;ref&gt;Aoki, Mizuho, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120307x1.html Tohoku fears nuke crisis evacuees gone for good]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 8 March 2012, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ex-prime minister [[Naoto Kan]] was interviewed about the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and has said that at one point Japan faced a situation where there was a chance that people might not be able to live in the capital zone including Tokyo and would have to evacuate. He says he is haunted by the specter of an even bigger nuclear crisis forcing tens of millions of people to flee Tokyo and threatening the nation's existence. "If things had reached that level, not only would the public have had to face hardships but Japan's very existence would have been in peril".&lt;ref name=k12/&gt; That convinced Kan to "declare the need for Japan to end its reliance on atomic power and promote renewable sources of energy such as solar that have long taken a back seat in the resource-poor country's energy mix".&lt;ref name=k12&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/17/us-japan-kan-idUSTRE81G08P20120217 |title=Nuclear crisis turns Japan ex-PM Kan into energy apostle |author=Linda Sieg and Yoko Kubota |date=Feb 17, 2012 |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; Government Officials revealed in interviews that they were grappling the possibility of a "demonic chain reaction": If Fukushima collapsed and released enough radiation, it was "possible that other nearby nuclear power plants would have to be abandoned and could also collapse, thereby necessitating the evacuation of one of the world’s largest cities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalspin.blogs.time.com/2012/02/29/panel-government-told-people-to-keep-calm-while-mulling-tokyo-evacuation/#ixzz1ntRd4YIz |title=Fukushima Report: Japan Urged Calm While It Mulled Tokyo Evacuation |author=Krista Mahr |date=February 29, 2012  |work=TIME }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evacuation drills===
In Japan, during each fiscal year, a prefecture that has nuclear power stations in its territory is legally bound to hold nuclear accident disaster drills, demonstrating how to evacuate the population out of the 10-kilometer evacuation zone according to the governmental anti-disaster guidelines. The Fukishima Daiichi accidents proved this 10-kilometer zone to be an underestimation of the evacuation zones that would actually be needed to protect the population of the prefecture from escaping radiation in a proper way. On 5 September 2011, three prefectures—Aomori, Fukushima and Ibaraki—were unable to hold the drills before March 2012. Six prefectures, including Hokkaido and Fukui, had not taken a decision to hold a drill and were awaiting new governmental guidelines on how far to evacuate. Four other prefectures, including Ehime and Saga, planned to hold drills by establishing temporary guidelines and by expanding evacuation zones on their own. The Nuclear Safety Commission aimed to review the evacuation zones and other policies by the end of October.&lt;ref&gt;''JAIF'' (5 September 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1315192330P.pdf 70% of prefectures baffled on nuclear drill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419005409/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1315192330P.pdf |date=2012-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revising the nuclear disaster response: widening evacuation zones===
On 20 October 2011, the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan published its views on the evacuation zones around nuclear plants in case of accidents. Instead of the 10-kilometer evacuation-zone previously thought to be sufficient to protect inhabitants, a circle of 30 kilometer was proposed as Urgent Protective Action Planning Zones, or UPZ. This definition was in line with the emergency response requirements proposed by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]. This draft plan included the designation of areas within 5 kilometers of plants as precautionary action zones, where residents would immediately evacuate in the event of an accident. Residents within a radius of about 50 kilometers would be prepared to take immediately action to prevent internal exposure to their thyroid glands by taking iodine tablets. Further studies were planned with experts and municipalities. Implementation of this plan would mean a major review of all anti-nuclear disaster programs by local governments, and it would increase the number of municipalities involved up to around 130, about three times more than the present figure.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (20 October 2011 ) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/20_25.html Nuke committee drafts disaster-response revisions ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020184052/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/20_25.html |date=2011-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (20 October 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1319168910P.pdf Earthquake-report 241: Nuke committee drafts disaster-response revisions ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517084407/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1319168910P.pdf |date=2013-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-term effects===
Experts on the ground in Japan agree that mental health challenges are the most significant issue.&lt;ref&gt;Sugimoto, T., Umeda, M., Shinozaki, T., Naruse, T. and Miyamoto, Y. (2015), Sources of perceived social support associated with reduced psychological distress at 1 year after the Great East Japan Earthquake: Nationwide cross-sectional survey in 2012. Psychiatry Clin Neurosci, 69: 580–586. doi:10.1111/pcn.12235&lt;/ref&gt; Stress, such as that caused by relocation and uncertainty and concern about unseen toxicants, often manifests in physical ailments, such as heart disease. So even if radiation risks are low, people are still concerned and worried.&lt;ref&gt;Sugimoto T, Shinozaki T, Naruse T, Miyamoto Y (2014) Who Was Concerned about Radiation, Food Safety, and Natural Disasters after the Great East Japan Earthquake and Fukushima Catastrophe?

People who lost their homes, villages and family members, and even just those who survived the quake, will likely continue to face mental health challenges and the physical ailments that come with stress. Much of the damage was really the psychological stress of not knowing and of being relocated, according to U.C. Berkeley [[adjunct professor]] Thomas E. McKone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=japans-post-fukushima-earthquake-health-woes-beyond-radiation&amp;page=3 |title=Japan's Post-Fukushima Earthquake Health Woes Go Beyond Radiation Effects |author=Katherine Harmon |date=March 2, 2012 |work=Nature |access-date=2012-07-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013113835/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=japans-post-fukushima-earthquake-health-woes-beyond-radiation&amp;page=3# |archive-date=2013-10-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meltdowns and radiation==
[[File:Fukushima I by Digital Globe.jpg|thumb|Three of the reactors at [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima Daiichi]] overheated, causing [[nuclear meltdown|meltdowns]] that eventually led to hydrogen explosions, which released large amounts of [[radioactive]] gases into the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/world/asia/02japan.html?_r=1&amp;ref=world |title=Report Finds Japan Underestimated Tsunami Danger |author=Martin Fackler |date=June 1, 2011 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Nuclear meltdown]]s at three of Fukushima Daiichi's six reactors went officially unacknowledged for months:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In one of the most damning admissions, nuclear regulators said in early June that inspectors had found tellurium 132, which experts call telltale evidence of reactor meltdowns, a day after the tsunami&amp;nbsp;— but did not tell the public for nearly three months. For months after the disaster, the government flip-flopped on the level of radiation permissible on school grounds, causing continuing confusion and anguish about the safety of schoolchildren here in Fukushima.&lt;ref name="nytaug"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At 12:33 JST on 13 March the Chief Cabinet Secretary, [[Yukio Edano]], was reported to have confirmed that there was a "significant chance" that radioactive fuel rods had partially melted in Unit 3 and Unit 1, or that "it was 'highly possible' a partial meltdown was underway".&lt;ref name="wp-partial"/&gt; "I am trying to be careful with words... This is not a situation where the whole core suffers a meltdown".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7feb0aaa-4d3d-11e0-85e4-00144feab49a.html#ixzz1GTlHI2Wv |title=Japan battles to stop nuclear catastrophe |work=Financial Times |date= |accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Edano denied that a meltdown was in progress. He claimed that the radioactive fuel rods had not partially melted and he emphasized that there was no danger to the health of the population.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/asiapacific/news/article_1625701.php/Government-No-meltdown-in-Japanese-nuclear-plant |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130129022230/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/asiapacific/news/article_1625701.php/Government-No-meltdown-in-Japanese-nuclear-plant |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 January 2013 |title=Government: No meltdown in Japanese nuclear plant |publisher=Monsters and Critics |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=13 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110314a1.html |title=Water injected into Fukushima reactor |publisher=The Japan Times Online |date= |accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edano later said that there were signs that the fuel rods were melting in all three reactors. "Although we cannot directly check it, it's highly likely happening".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/energy/japanese-officials-nuclear-fuel-rods-melting-in-3-reactors-20110314|title=Japanese Officials: Nuclear Fuel Rods Appear to be Melting in 3 Reactors|date=14 March 2011|publisher=NationalJournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011 the United States [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] said that some of the core of a stricken Japanese reactor had probably leaked from its steel pressure vessel into the bottom of the containment structure, implying that the reactor damage was worse than previously thought. If molten fuel has "left the reactor’s pressure vessel and reached the drywell in substantial quantities, it raises the possibility that the fuel could escape the larger containment structure, leading to a large-scale radioactive release".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/world/asia/07japan.html?_r=1&amp;src=me |title=Core of Stricken Reactor Probably Leaked, U.S. Says  |author=Matthew L. Wald  |date= April 6, 2011  |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan, "by April 27 approximately 55 percent of the fuel in reactor unit 1 had melted, along with 35 percent of the fuel in unit 2, and 30 percent of the fuel in unit 3; and overheated spent fuels in the storage pools of units 3 and 4 probably were also damaged".&lt;ref name=bas2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/five-steps-to-prevent-another-fukushima |title=Five steps to prevent another Fukushima |author= Jungmin Kang  |date=4 May 2011  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The accident has surpassed the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]] in seriousness, and is comparable to the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.&lt;ref name=bas2011/&gt; ''The Economist'' reports that the Fukushima disaster is "a bit like three Three Mile Islands in a row, with added damage in the spent-fuel stores",&lt;ref name=econ2011&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18441163 |title=Nuclear power: When the steam clears |author= |date=March 24, 2011 |work=The Economist |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that there will be ongoing impacts:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Years of clean-up will drag into decades. A permanent exclusion zone could end up stretching beyond the plant’s perimeter. Seriously exposed workers may be at increased risk of cancers for the rest of their lives...&lt;ref name=econ2011/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On March 24, 2011, Japanese officials announced that "radioactive iodine-131 exceeding safety limits for infants had been detected at 18 water-purification plants in Tokyo and five other prefectures". Officials said also that the fallout from the Dai-ichi plant is "hindering search efforts for victims from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2011/03/report-radioactive-emissions-from-japan-plant-approach-chernobyl-levels/1 |title=Report: Emissions from Japan plant approach Chernobyl levels  |author=Michael Winter |date=March 24, 2011 |work=USA Today |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report from the Japanese Government to the IAEA says the "nuclear fuel in three reactors probably melted through the inner containment vessels, not just the core". The report says the "inadequate" basic reactor design&amp;nbsp;— the Mark-1 model developed by General Electric&amp;nbsp;— included "the venting system for the containment vessels and the location of spent fuel cooling pools high in the buildings, which resulted in leaks of radioactive water that hampered repair work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-japan-nuclear-report-20110608,0,7481490.story?track=rss |title=Japan says it was unprepared for post-quake nuclear disaster |author= |date=June 8, 2011 |work=Los Angeles Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608222345/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-japan-nuclear-report-20110608%2C0%2C7481490.story?track=rss |archivedate=June 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2011, the Japanese government has been unable to control the spread of radioactive material into the nation's food, and "Japanese agricultural officials say meat from more than 500 cattle that were likely to have been contaminated with radioactive cesium has made its way to supermarkets and restaurants across Japan". Radioactive material has also been detected in a range of other produce, including spinach, tea leaves, milk, and fish, up to 200 miles from the nuclear plant. Inside the 12-mile evacuation zone around the plant, all farming has been abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/26/world/asia/26beef.html?_r=1 |title=Japan Lifts Ban on Beef From Disaster Area |author=Hiroko Tabuchi |date=August 25, 2011 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/world/asia/19beef.html?_r=1 |title=Radiation-Tainted Beef Spreads Through Japan’s Markets |author=Hiroko Tabuchi |date=July 18, 2011  |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2011, the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant is still leaking low levels of radioactive material and areas surrounding it could remain uninhabitable for decades due to high radiation. It could take "more than 20 years before residents could safely return to areas with current radiation readings of 200 millisieverts per year, and a decade for areas at 100 millisieverts per year".&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/27/us-japan-nuclear-uninhabitable-idUSTRE77Q17U20110827 |title=Areas near Japan nuclear plant may be off limits for decades |author= |date=August 27, 2011  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six months after the beginning of the Fukushima crisis, [[Mycle Schneider]] says the situation remains desperate:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...the technical situation at the Fukushima Daiichi plant is everything but stable. Families and farmers in the region remain desperate. Evacuated families had to leave their pets starving and don't know if they ever can go back to their homes. Farmers had to kill their cattle and destroy their harvests. Some finished by killing themselves. A French independent radioactivity-measuring lab announced recently that it identified up to 700,000 becquerel of cesium per square meter on grass in a primary school in Fukushima City, over 60 kilometers from the Daiichi plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/fukushima-crisis-can-japan-be-the-forefront-of-authentic-paradigm-shift |title=Fukushima crisis: Can Japan be at the forefront of an authentic paradigm shift? |author=Mycle Schneider |date=9 September 2011 |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106021131/http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/fukushima-crisis-can-japan-be-the-forefront-of-authentic-paradigm-shift |archivedate= 6 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Radiation in schools===
In the non-evacuated areas, the exposure limit for schoolyards was raised to 20 millisieverts per year. This non-negligible value (less than the 50 millisieverts yearly limit for nuclear workers in many countries) led to a large public reaction, including the resignation of Toshiso Kosako, special adviser on nuclear matters to the Japanese Government. The government then had to "flip-flop" on the issue of radiation standards in schools, causing "continuing confusion and anguish about the safety of schoolchildren in Fukushima".&lt;ref name="nytaug"/&gt;

Because of radiation concerns, tens of thousands of children are being kept inside school buildings during the hot summer, where some wear masks even though the windows are kept shut. They are banned from their own school playgrounds, unable to play in local parks and kept inside by their parents. Workers are removing the surface soil from schoolyards contaminated with radioactive particles from the nuclear plant, despite often having nowhere to dump the soil, except in holes dug in the same grounds.&lt;ref name="nytaug"/&gt;

The results of a scientific survey conducted in March show that about 45 percent of 1,080 children in three Fukushima communities tested positive for thyroid exposure to radiation. The government has said that the levels were too low to warrant further examination.&lt;ref name="nytaug"/&gt;

As of September 2011, a total of 16 elementary and junior high schools in Fukushima communities remained closed.&lt;ref name="mdn.mainichi.jp"/&gt;

===Hotspots===
In October 2011, radiation levels as high as those in the evacuation zone around Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant have been detected in a Tokyo suburb. Japanese officials said the contamination was linked to the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Contaminations levels "as high as those inside Fukushima's no-go zone have been detected, with officials speculating that the hotspot was created after radioactive caesium carried in rain water became concentrated because of a broken gutter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianetworknews.com/stories/201110/3347154.htm?desktop |title=Radiation hotspot found in Tokyo |author=[[Mark Willacy]] |date=25 October 2011 |work=Australia Network News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423163316/http://australianetworknews.com/stories/201110/3347154.htm?desktop |archivedate=23 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011 the Japanese ministry of Science launched a telephone hotline to deal with public concerns about radiation exposure in areas outside Fukushima Prefecture. Concerned Japanese citizens had taken up a new hobby: walking with Geiger-counters through their city or village in search for all places with raised radiation levels. Whenever a site was found with a radiation dose at one meter above the ground more than one microsievert per hour and higher than nearby areas, this should be mentioned at the hotline. One microsievert per hour is the limit above this topsoil at school playgrounds would be removed, subsidized by the state of Japan. Local governments were asked to carry out simple decontamination works, such as clearing mud from ditches if necessary. When radiation levels would remain more than one microsievert higher than nearby areas even after the cleaning, the ministry offered to help with further decontamination. On the website of the ministry a guideline was posted on how to measure radiation levels in a proper way, how to hold the dosimeter and how long to wait for a proper reading.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (24 October 2011)[ NHK {{cite web |url=http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/24_20.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724224255/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/24_20.html |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }} {{cite web |url=http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/24_20.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724224255/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/24_20.html |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (24 October 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1319440559P.pdf Earthquake-report 244] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516162319/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1319440559P.pdf |date=2013-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TEPCO response==

On 1 April 2011, ''[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]'' reported that the plant's operators were "woefully unprepared for the scale of the disaster". Water is still being poured into the damaged reactors to cool melting fuel rods. John Price, a former member of the Safety Policy Unit at the UK's National Nuclear Corporation, has said that it "might be 100 years before melting fuel rods can be safely removed from Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/04/01/3179487.htm |title=Crews 'facing 100-year battle' at Fukushima |author=David Mark, Mark Willacy |date=April 1, 2011 |work=ABC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three weeks after the beginning of the disaster in Fukushima, ''[[Spiegel Online]]'' reported how "helpless and casual" TEPCO has been in its improvised efforts to cope with the accident. The company hasn't put forward a strategy to regain control over the situation in the reactors.

TEPCO could face 2 trillion yen ($23.6 bln) in special losses in the current business year to March 2012 to compensate communities near its crippled Fukushima I nuclear plant, according to [[JP Morgan|JPMorgan Chase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/11/us-japan-tepco-compensation-r-idUSTRE73A8BH20110411 |title=Tepco may face $23.6 billion compensation costs: JP Morgan |author=Antoni Slodkowski |date=April 11, 2011   |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2011, TEPCOs stock has "slumped 91 percent, erasing 3.2 trillion yen ($40 billion) in market value".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-09/police-to-send-riot-squads-to-tepco-meeting.html |title=Police to Send Riot Squads to Tepco Meeting |author=Takahiko Hyuga and Tsuyoshi Inajima  |date=June 10, 2011  |work=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan plans to put TEPCO under effective state control so it can meet its compensation payments to people affected by radiation from its Fukushima I plant.  Tokyo will set aside several trillion yen in public funds that TEPCO can "dip into if it runs short for payouts to people affected".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/japan-to-control-tepco-to-handle-compensation-claims-after-nuclear-disaster/story-e6frf7k6-1226042278008 |title=Japan to control TEPCO to handle compensation claims after nuclear disaster |author= |date=April 20, 2011   |work=Herald Sun }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting at 22 March 2011 TEPCO compiled a radiation map of the surroundings of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. At 150 spots around the buildings the radiation was monitored. This map, the governmental data provided by SPEEDI (System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information) and the data of the Japan Meteorological Agency's were shared&amp;nbsp;– the same day&amp;nbsp;– to the United States and other international institutes. On 23 March, a day later, NISA was informed. Almost every day TEPCO officials and NRC staffers continued to share updated versions of the map by e-mail. The information was kept secret for the Japanese public until 24 April 2011, only after the media reported details of the map on 23 April 2011, a day earlier.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (12 February 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120212p2g00m0dm019000c.html TEPCO provided radiation map to U.S. before Japanese public] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212192820/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120212p2g00m0dm019000c.html |date=2012-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further investigations were done after the cause of the leakage. A valve was opened by error, this caused an inflow of water to the tank. Around 2 p.m. on 19 Feb. an alarm went off, indicating that the tank was dangerously filled. This alarm was ignored, because no radioactive water was transferred to the tank. The tank, however, got overfilled, and the radioactive access water left the tank along the rain-gutter. Because all rainwater is directed outside the barriers around the tanks, the overflowing radioactive water seeped directly into the grounds.&lt;ref&gt;The Asahi Shimbun (20 February 2014)[http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201402200051 100 tons of radioactive water spills at Fukushima plant after workers ignore alarm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226170722/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201402200051 |date=2014-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to TEPCO all leakage was due to human error. The patrols were doubled to twice a day, and the number of workers involved was increased 6 times to 60 people. Because the leak was about 700 meters from the coastal line, TEPCO did believe that none of this water had reached the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;The Asahi Shimbun (21 February 2014) [http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201402210062 TEPCO says worker error may have caused large radioactive water leak] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226170744/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201402210062 |date=2014-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February 2014 Hideka Morimoto, deputy secretary-general of the NRA, said during a news conference, that the recurring problems and the recent discovery of the 100-ton loss of highly tainted water on the Fukushima No.1 plant had raised questions at the NRA, whether TEPCO as a firm was competent enough to solve all difficulties at the plant. According to him, quote : "This will generate controversy over TEPCO's safety culture and its ability to cope as a business operator".&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (22 February 2014) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20140222p2a00m0na002000c.html NRA official says Fukushima problems raising questions over TEPCO's competence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228063427/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20140222p2a00m0na002000c.html |date=2014-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been blackouts throughout Tokyo and eight other prefectures. These blackouts have depressed economic output and made it harder for the economy to recover from the earthquake.

At an annual food safety exhibition in Tokyo held on 26 to 28 October 2011, machines were shown that could measure radiation: on conveyor belts food and other objects could be proofed by a radiation sensor, and the outcome could be read within 12 seconds. In this way a large number of objects could be checked in a very short time. Despite the huge price: 56,000 dollars, farmers, beef processors and restaurant chains showed great interest. Smaller devices to check food for radioactivity were shown, testing food placed in beakers. These could be used by smaller firms or even in households. The lowest cost of these small machines was still around 9,000 dollars.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (26 October 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/26_24.html Food safety fair features radiation monitors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828093744/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/26_24.html |date=2011-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of public concerns about radioactive contamination of food, Aeon, a Japanese supermarket chain, decided to publish the results of voluntary radiation tests performed on food of Japanese origin in their stores. The information was available on the website, and on posters in stores. Fish, vegetables, rice, beef and more were controlled by the shops since March 2011. All products with 50 becquerels per kilogram, one-tenth of the government's provisional limit, were rejected and not offered in stores. In the first week of November 2011 radioactive cesium was found in Pacific cod and rice from Fukushima, in tuna from Miyagi, and in bonito from [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]]. The customers were offered a list of all contaminated food that was found, its radioactivity levels and production areas.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (9 November 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/09_03.html Aeon releases results of radiation checks on food] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111080452/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/09_03.html |date=2011-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 26 two dozen Diet members signed a letter calling on the government to "immediately get young children and pregnant women out of the 30-km danger zone around the heavily damaged Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant". The statement also called for "extending the current 20-km mandatory evacuation zone radically to avoid further exposure and discontinuing official declarations that there is no immediate harm to human health, charging they aren't properly transmitting to the public the dangers of possible long-term radiation harm". The statement, drawn up by anti-nuclear groups, is to be delivered to Prime Minister Naoto Kan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110326b3.html |title=Get kids, pregnant women well clear of nuke zone: politicians |author=Eric Johnston |date=March 26, 2011 |work=Japan Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 30 there was growing consensus that the severity of the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] had surpassed the [[Three Mile Island accident]] to become the world's second-worst nuclear accident. The early effects on Japanese public opinion and government policy were felt. [[NGO]]s and anti-nuclear groups gained credibility, including [[Greenpeace]], which launched a study on the impact of the Fukushima crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/172364.html |title=Japan disaster boosting anti-nuclear movement |author=Michael Penn |date=March 30, 2011 |work=Press TV }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31 an anti-nuclear activist attempted to drive into the radioactivity-leaking Fukushima I complex, and later crashed through a locked gate at the Fukushima II power plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2011/03/gate-crasher-drives-around-2nd-fukushima-complex-after-failing-at-crippled-plant/1 |title=Activist crashes gate at 2nd Fukushima nuke facility; failed at crippled plant |author=Michael Winter |date=March 31, 2011  |work=USA Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-April, 17,000 people protested at two demonstrations in Tokyo against nuclear power.&lt;ref name="Michael Alison Chandler"/&gt;&lt;ref name=krista/&gt; One protester, Yohei Nakamura, said nuclear power is a serious problem and that anti-nuclear demonstrations were undercovered in the Japanese press because of the influence of the Tokyo Electric Power Co. He said that "If the mass media shows anti-nuclear-power activities like demonstrations, they risk losing TEPCO as an advertiser."&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=krista&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ecocentric.blogs.time.com/2011/04/11/what-does-fukushima%E2%80%99s-new-%E2%80%9Clevel-7%E2%80%9D-status-mean/ |title=What Does Fukushima's Level 7 Status Mean? |author=Krista Mahr  |date= April 11, 2011 |work=Time }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three months after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, thousands of anti-nuclear protesters marched in Japan. Company workers, students, and parents with children rallied across Japan, "venting their anger at the government's handling of the crisis, carrying flags bearing the words 'No Nukes!' and 'No More Fukushima'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/15/columns-us-japan-nuclear-protest-idUSTRE75A0QH20110615 |title=Japan anti-nuclear protesters rally after quake |author=Antoni Slodkowski |date=June 15, 2011  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ongoing Fukushima crisis may spell the end of nuclear power in Japan, as "citizen opposition grows and local authorities refuse permission to restart reactors that have undergone safety checks". Local authorities are skeptical that sufficient safety measures have been taken and are reticent to give their permission&amp;nbsp;– now required by law&amp;nbsp;– to bring suspended nuclear reactors back online.&lt;ref name=refuse2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2011/0620/Beginning-of-the-end-for-nuclear-power-in-Japan |title=Beginning of the end for nuclear power in Japan? |author=Gavin Blair, |date=June 20, 2011  |work=CSMonitor }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 60,000 people in Japan marched in demonstrations in Tokyo, Osaka, Hiroshima and Fukushima on June 11, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-26/fukushima-retiree-to-lead-anti-nuclear-motion.html |title=Fukushima Retiree Leads Anti-Nuclear Shareholders at Tepco Annual Meeting |author=Tomoko Yamazaki and Shunichi Ozasa  |date=June 27, 2011 |work=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Japanese mothers, many new to political activism, have started "taking to the streets to urge the government to protect their children from radioactive material leaking from the crippled Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant". Using social networking media, such as Facebook and Twitter, they have "organized antinuclear energy rallies nationwide attended by thousands of protesters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110709f2.html |title=Moms rally around antinuke cause |author=Junko Horiuichi |date=July 9, 2011 |work=The Japan Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the Hidankyo, the group representing the 10,000 or so survivors of the atomic bombings in Japan, called for the first time for the elimination of civilian nuclear power. In its action plan for 2012, the group appealed for "halting construction of new nuclear plants and the gradual phasing out of Japan’s 54 current reactors as energy alternatives are found".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/world/asia/07hiroshima.html?_r=1 |title=Atomic Bomb Survivors Join Nuclear Opposition |author=Martin Fackler |date=August 6, 2011  |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sumiteru Taniguchi, director of the Nagasaki Council of A-Bomb Sufferers, has linked the Fukushima disaster to the atomic bombings of Japan:&lt;ref name=amyg/&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In August 2011, about 2,500 people including farmers and fishermen marched in Tokyo. They are suffering heavy losses following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and called for prompt compensation from plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. and the government, chanting slogans such as "TEPCO must pay compensation swiftly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110813p2g00m0dm011000c.html |title=Fukushima farmers, fishermen protest over nuclear crisis |author= |date=August 13, 2011 |work=Mainichi Daily News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902124656/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110813p2g00m0dm011000c.html |archivedate=September 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, anti-nuclear protesters, marching to the beat of drums, "took to the streets of Tokyo and other cities to mark six months since the March earthquake and tsunami and vent their anger at the government's handling of the nuclear crisis set off by meltdowns at the Fukushima power plant".&lt;ref name=reut11/&gt; An estimated 2,500 people marched past TEPCO headquarters, and created a human chain around the building of the Trade Ministry that oversees the power industry. Protesters called for a complete shutdown of Japanese nuclear power plants and demanded a shift in government policy toward alternative sources of energy. Among the protestors were four young men who started a 10-day hunger strike to bring about change in Japan's nuclear policy.&lt;ref name=reut11&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/11/us-japan-quake-protests-idUSTRE78A1AB20110911 |title=Japan anti-nuclear protests mark 6 months since quake |author=Olivier Fabre |date=11 September 2011 |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tens of thousands of people marched in central Tokyo in September 2011, chanting "[[Sayonara Nuclear Power Plants|Sayonara nuclear power]]" and waving banners, to call on Japan's government to abandon atomic energy in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Author [[Kenzaburō Ōe]], who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1994, and has campaigned for pacifist and anti-nuclear causes addressed the crowd. Musician [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]], who composed the score to the movie "[[The Last Emperor]]" was also among the event's supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2011-09-19/japan-anti-nuclear-protest/50461872/1 |title=Thousands march against nuclear power in Tokyo |author= |date=September 2011 |work=USA Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political reaction==

On 23 March 2011, ten days after the hydrogen explosions, the recommendations of the [[Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission|Nuclear Safety Commission]] of Japan to protect the people living near the exploded Fukushima reactors were put aside by the Japanese government. The proposed measures were based on the results provided by a computer program named SPEEDI (System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information). This program was specially designed to predict the spread of radioactive materials after a nuclear accident. The proposed measurements included evacuations and administering iodine tablets to people to minimize their intake of radioactive iodine. However, the office of the Prime Minister decided that ten days after the explosions it was too late, and did not act on the proposals. These facts came to light in the first weeks of December 2011, when a government panel examined the details about the delay in utilizing the data produced by SPEEDI.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (14 December 2011)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111214p2g00m0dm030000c.html Nuclear disaster response recommendations shelved 10 days after explosion ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214191244/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111214p2g00m0dm030000c.html |date=2011-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister Naoto Kan's ruling party suffered embarrassing losses in April local elections after the Japanese leader came under fire over the nuclear disaster, further weakening his influence and bolstering rivals who want him to quit once the crisis ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/11/us-japan-politics-idUSTRE73A0HR20110411 |title=Japan PM weakened by local election losses, nuclear woes |author=Linda Sieg and Chisa Fujioka |date= April 10, 2011 |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fukushima Governor [[Yūhei Satō]] refused to meet former TEPCO president Masataka Shimizu on two occasions due to his anger at the utility's handling of the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-11/tepco-chief-rebuffed-in-fukushima-as-crisis-enters-second-month.html Tepco Chief Rebuffed by Fukushima Leader for Second Time on Nuclear Anger]&lt;/ref&gt; Shimizu later resigned.

Problems in stabilizing the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant have hardened attitudes to [[nuclear power]]. As of June 2011, "more than 80 percent of Japanese now say they are anti-nuclear and distrust government information on [[radiation]]".&lt;ref name=refuse2011/&gt; The ongoing Fukushima crisis may spell the end of nuclear power in Japan, as "citizen opposition grows and local authorities refuse permission to restart reactors that have undergone safety checks". Local authorities are skeptical that sufficient safety measures have been taken and are reticent to give their permission&amp;nbsp;– now required by law&amp;nbsp;– to bring suspended nuclear reactors back online.&lt;ref name="refuse2011"/&gt;

Prime Minister Naoto Kan took an increasingly anti-nuclear stance in the months following the Fukushima disaster. In May, he ordered the aging [[Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant]] be closed over earthquake and tsunami fears, and he said he would freeze plans to build new reactors. In July 2011, Kan said that "Japan should reduce and eventually eliminate its dependence on nuclear energy in what would be a radical shift in the country’s energy policy, saying that the Fukushima accident had demonstrated the dangers of the technology".&lt;ref name="Hiroko Tabuchi"/&gt; Kan said Japan should abandon plans to build 14 new reactors by 2030. He wants to "pass a bill to promote renewable energy and questioned whether private companies should be running atomic plants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-13/kan-takes-on-japan-s-nuclear-village-in-renewable-energy-drive.html |title=‘Nuclear Village’ Protester Turns Hero as Fukushima Drives Atomic Backlash |author=Stuart Biggs and Kanoko Matsuyama  |date =Jul 14, 2011 |work=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benjamin K. Sovacool has said that, with the benefit of hindsight, the Fukushima disaster was entirely avoidable in that Japan could have chosen to exploit the country's extensive renewable energy base.&lt;ref name=bks2011&gt;[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', [[World Scientific]], p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest positive result of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster could be renewed public support for the [[Renewable energy commercialization|commercialization of renewable energy technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2011/0503/Japan-s-nuclear-energy-debate-some-see-spur-for-a-renewable-revolution |title=Japan's nuclear energy debate: some see spur for a renewable revolution |author=Justin McCurry |date=May 3, 2011 |work=CSMonitor }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, the Japanese Government passed a bill to subsidize electricity from renewable energy sources. The legislation will become effective on July 1, 2012, and require utilities to buy electricity generated by renewable sources including [[solar power]], [[wind power]] and [[geothermal energy]] at above-market rates.&lt;ref name="Chisaki Watanabe"/&gt;

In March 2012, Prime Minister [[Yoshihiko Noda]] acknowledged that the government shared the blame for the Fukushima disaster, saying that officials had been blinded by a false belief in the country's "technological infallibility", and were all too steeped in a "safety myth". Mr. Noda said "Everybody must share the pain of responsibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/world/asia/japans-premier-says-government-shares-blame-for-fukushima-disaster.html |title=Japanese Prime Minister Says Government Shares Blame for Nuclear Disaster |author=Hiroko Tabuchi |date=March 3, 2012  |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigations of the Japanese Lower House===
The special committee of the Japanese Lower House investigating the Fukushima disaster had requested to TEPCO to submit its procedural manuals for accidents by the end of the whole first week of September. But when the accident manuals were submitted to the Diet committee most of the contents was blacked out and heavily redacted. On 12 September 3 pages were presented, including a cover sheet, containing an index of actions to be taken in serious accidents. Most of the index was blacked out and TEPCO did collect the papers immediately after the meeting, explaining that this was restricted information with copyrights, that was not allowed to be made public. The special committee did ask the industry ministry to order the utility to resubmit the manuals in their original form, as required by law. NISA said it would consider what actions to take.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (13 September 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1315904987P.pdf Earthquake report 203: TEPCO submits blacked-out manual to Diet committee] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103100615/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1315904987P.pdf |date=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2011, there is a complex power struggle underway over the future of nuclear energy in Japan involving political, governmental, industry, and union groups. Despite the seriousness of the Fukushima crisis, Japan's "historical commitment to nuclear power – and a fuel cycle that includes reprocessing and breeder reactors – still has powerful supporters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/5/19 |title=Nuclear or not?

In February 2012, an independent investigation into the accident by the Rebuild Japan Initiative Foundation said that "In the darkest moments of last year’s nuclear accident, Japanese leaders did not know the actual extent of damage at the plant and secretly considered the possibility of evacuating Tokyo, even as they tried to play down the risks in public".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/28/world/asia/japan-considered-tokyo-evacuation-during-the-nuclear-crisis-report-says.html?_r=1 |title=Japan Weighed Evacuating Tokyo in Nuclear Crisis |author=Martin Fackler |date=February 27, 2012  |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New legal restrictions for exposure to radiation proposed===
On 6 October 2011 a government panel proposed to ease the legal restrictions for exposure to radiation in the contaminated areas with radioactive fallout, because in their opinion it would be extremely difficult to limit exposure below the legal limit of 1 millisievert per year. Instead the target should be set between 1 and 20 millisieverts in line with the recommendations by the International Commission for Radiological Protection. Targets should be lowered in steps as decontamination proceeded. Targets might differ by region and residents should have a voice in setting the targets.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (6 October 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1317956641P.pdf Earthquake-report 227: Government panel mulls interim goals on radiation dose] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028152528/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1317956641P.pdf |date=2011-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Request for decommissioning the Tokai Daini Power plant===
On 11 October 2011 Tatsuya Murakami, the mayor of the village [[Tōkai, Ibaraki|Tokai]], said in a meeting with minister [[Goshi Hosono]], that the [[Tōkai Nuclear Power Plant|Tokai Daini reactor]], situated 110 kilometer from [[Tokyo|Tokio]], should be decommissioned, because the plant was more than 30 years old and the people had lost confidence in the nuclear safety commission of the government.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (12 October 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1318403487P.pdf Tokai mayor wants nuclear reactor decommissioned ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517074905/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1318403487P.pdf |date=2013-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fukushima wants all 10 nuclear reactors scrapped===
The assembly of Fukushima Prefecture has adopted a motion that asks for the scrapping of all 10 nuclear reactors in the prefecture. The majority vote was on Thursday 20 October 2011, after the petition was submitted by a civic group in June. The petition urged the decommissioning of all reactors run by TEPCO in the prefecture—six at the Daiichi plant and four at the Daini plant. This was the first time in Japan that a prefecture hosting nuclear plants has voted to adopt such a petition. Although TEPCO was planning to decommission four reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, TEPCO still had detailed plans to exploit the remaining six reactors.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (20 October 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/20_33.html Fukushima assembly OKs reactor decommission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029041653/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/20_33.html |date=2011-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (20 October 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1319168910P.pdf Earthquake-report 241: Fukushima assembly OKs reactor decommission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517084407/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1319168910P.pdf |date=2013-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TEPCO request for government compensation===
In his answer to TEPCO, after its request of 120 billion yen in government compensation, the minister of Industry Yukio Edano told TEPCO on 24 October 2011 to cut "at least" 2.5 trillion yen in its costs over the coming 10 years before TEPCO would receive any funds to help it to pay the compensations over the nuclear crisis at its Fukushima Daiichi power plant. This target was the outcome of a report from an independent commission that the Japanese government received on 3 October, in it their thoughts about how TEPCO's special business plan should be compiled as a precondition to receive financial aid from a state-backed body set up to help it meet its massive compensation obligations. Next to cost-cutting this special business plan would also include restructuring measurements. First plan would be an "emergency" plan, and the second plan should have a "comprehensive" character. This last plan should be completed in spring 2012.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (24 October 2011)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111024p2g00m0dm105000c.html Edano tells TEPCO to cut 'at least' 2.5 tril. yen in costs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024190829/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111024p2g00m0dm105000c.html |date=2011-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===At least 1 trillion yen needed for decontamination===
In October 2011, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said the government will spend at least 1 trillion yen ($13 billion) to clean up vast areas contaminated by radiation from the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Japan "faces the prospect of removing and disposing 29 million cubic meters of soil from a sprawling area in Fukushima, located 240 kilometers (150 miles) northeast of Tokyo, and four nearby prefectures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/20/us-japan-nuclear-noda-idUSTRE79J3W020111020?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews |title=Japan to spend at least $13 billion for decontamination |author=Rie Ishiguro |date=20 October 2011 |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese nuclear reactors taken offline===
On 28 October 2011, of the 55 nuclear reactors in Japan, 44 were taken off the grid, in most instances to undergo safety inspections. Stress-tests demanded by the Japanese government were performed at 18 reactors. Of the reactors still in operation, four more would be closed down before the end of 2011, and the rest would follow in the first months of 2012. Because the disaster had raised serious safety concerns among local authorities, and they were reluctant to give permission to restart,&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (28 October 2011)[http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/28_28.html Over 80% of Japan's reactors offline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101070256/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/28_28.html |date=2011-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (29 October 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1319860744P.pdf Earthquake-report 249: Over 80% of Japan's reactors offline ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517073954/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1319860744P.pdf |date=2013-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; only two reactors were eventually restarted, both at the Ohi facility. On September 14, 2013, those reactors were shut down, leaving all 50 Japanese commercial nuclear reactors closed.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg News (15 September 2013) [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-16/shutdown-of-japan-s-last-nuclear-reactor-raises-power-concerns.html Shutdown of Japan’s Last Nuclear Reactor Raises Power Concerns]&lt;/ref&gt;

An energy white paper, approved by the Japanese Cabinet in October 2011, says "public confidence in safety of nuclear power was greatly damaged" by the Fukushima disaster, and calls for a reduction in the nation's reliance on nuclear power. It also omits a section on nuclear power expansion that was in last year's policy review.&lt;ref name="Tsuyoshi Inajima and Yuji Okada"/&gt;

===Extra staff members for Kiev embassy===
On 30 October 2011 the Japanese government took up the plan to increase the 30 members of the staff at the Japanese embassy in Kiev, Ukraine to 36. For the first time two nuclear experts and three interpreters will be stationed here. In order to learn from the experience of this country with the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe. In this way Japan hoped to build on good relations between the two countries, also because growing numbers of Japanese officials were visiting Ukraine at that moment. The new staff was expected to gather information about handling a no-go zone, the removal of radioactive materials, and how to deal with internal exposure to radiation. People affected by the Chernobyl disaster would also be questioned. The embassy was equipped with dosimeters and protection outfits for field studies. The extra costs of the additional embassy staff was estimated at 200 million yen.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (31 October 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111031p2g00m0dm005000c.html Japan to boost embassy staff in Ukraine with nuclear experts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031184810/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111031p2g00m0dm005000c.html |date=2011-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy debate changed in Japan===
Long one of the world's most committed promoters of civilian nuclear power, the trauma of the Fukushima disaster has changed attitudes in Japan. Political and energy experts describe "nothing short of a nationwide loss of faith, not only in Japan's once-vaunted nuclear technology but also in the government, which many blame for allowing the accident to happen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/09/world/asia/japan-shutting-down-its-nuclear-power-industry.html?ref=energyandpower |title=Japan’s Nuclear Energy Industry Nears Shutdown, at Least for Now |author=Martin Fackler |date=March 8, 2012  |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Japan Times]]'', the Fukushima nuclear disaster changed the national debate over energy policy almost overnight. "By shattering the government's long-pitched safety myth about nuclear power, the crisis dramatically raised public awareness about energy use and sparked strong anti-nuclear sentiment". A June 2011 Asahi Shimbun poll of 1,980 respondents found that 74 percent answered "yes" to whether Japan should gradually decommission all 54 reactors and become nuclear free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120103f1.html |title=Fukushima meltdowns set nuclear energy debate on its ear |author=Kazuaki Nagata |date=Jan 3, 2012 |work=The Japan Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===40 year limit for lifespan of nuclear reactors===
On 6 January 2012 the Japanese government proposed a maximum lifespan for nuclear reactors of 40 years. This was one of many proposals that nuclear crisis minister Goshi Hosono announced to review the nuclear safety regulations for nuclear reactors and nuclear fuel material. This was the first time that the Japanese government had tried to regulate the lifespan of nuclear power plants. When safety and maintenance of the plant meet regulatory guidelines, the operator could request for an extension. Safety standards against earthquakes, tsunamis and other disasters would be revised with the new knowledge and technology in protective measures. Power companies were to comply with the new standards. Approval of the new law by the parliament was scheduled not before the end of January 2012, but ahead of the installation of the new nuclear safety agency in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (7 January 2012)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1325907598P.pdf JAIF: earthquake report 310: Govt to limit life of nuclear reactors to 40 years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121041240/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1325907598P.pdf |date=2012-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meeting with two ministers boycotted by mayors===
On 26 February 2012 a meeting with Goshi Hosono, minister of Environment, and Tatsuo Hirano, minister in charge of reconstruction, and the mayors of eight cities and villages near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant was cancelled. Three mayors boycotted the meeting in a protest, because the government had already informed the media about the meeting's agenda prior to informing them. Katsutaka Idogawa, the mayor of [[Futaba, Fukushima|Futaba]], told a press conference, "I strongly mistrust the government... So I have made a momentous decision not to attend the meeting"  The mayors of the towns of [[Hirono, Fukushima|Hirono]] and [[Namie, Fukushima|Namie]] also refused to go. This meeting was intended to discuss how to get rid of the radioactive material emitted by the plant and find a place for temporary facilities to store contaminated soil. The meeting was cancelled, instead Hosono and Hirano had an informal discussion with the five remaining municipal leaders.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (27 February 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120227p2g00m0dm046000c.html 3 Fukushima mayors boycott meeting with gov't ministers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301185233/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120227p2g00m0dm046000c.html |date=2012-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food aid used to lower fears for contaminated food abroad===
To overcome public fears over contaminated food, Japan planned to supply food aid to the U.N. World Food Program. On 16 March 2011 the agreement was signed. Food products from disaster-hit eastern Japan would be used as overseas aid, in an attempt to lower the fears of radioactive contamination. For this a supplementary budget of 1 billion yen for the year 2011 was made available. Canned fish products produced in the prefectures Aomori, Iwate, Ibaraki and Chiba, certified and controlled for radioactive contamination&amp;nbsp;– would be sent to Cambodia and developing countries, to be used to feed schoolchildren. With this Japan planned to subsidize the fishing industry in the disaster-hit region, and hoped to revive the export of their products.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (17 March 2012) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120317p2g00m0dm003000c.html Japan using overseas food aid to help dispel contamination fears] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120722045847/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120317p2g00m0dm003000c.html |date=2012-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Okuma asked to be declared as no-go zone===
On 28 March 2012 mayor Toshitsuna Watanabe of the town [[Okuma, Fukushima|Okuma]] said during a meeting of the municipal assembly held at its temporary town office in [[Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima|Aizuwakamatsu]] that he will ask the whole town to be designated as no-go area, where it is unlikely that residents will be able to return in any foreseeable future, because he did not want the community of the town divided. Likewise the town [[Futaba, Fukushima|Futaba]] considered refusing any re-designation of the evacuation zones in the town.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (29 March 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120329p2a00m0na016000c.html Fukushima town seeks long-term designation as no-go zone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330122156/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120329p2a00m0na016000c.html |date=2012-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postponement of analog television shutdown in Fukushima===
The five television stations licensed to the cities of Fukushima and Koriyama (NHK Fukushima, [[Fukushima Central Television|FCT]], [[Fukushima Broadcasting|KFB]], TV-U Fukushima, and Fukushima Television) were originally scheduled to shut down their [[analog television|analog signals]] on 24 July 2011. However, a month prior to the scheduled date, the Japanese senate postponed the [[analog shutdown]] in Fukushima and the prefectures of [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]] and [[Miyagi Prefecture|Miyagi]] to the north. Television stations in all three prefectures shut off their analog signals at noon on 31 March 2012.

===No-return zone===
At a meeting on 3 April 2012 in [[Futaba, Fukushima|Futaba]] with Mayor Katsutaka Idogawa and Governor Yuhei Sato of Fukushima, minister Tatsuo Hirano of Reconstruction made a few personal remarks about the possibility that some places around the Fukushima nuclear power plant could be designated a no-return zone. One of the reasons he gave was the large number of storage tanks holding highly contaminated water that was used to cool the damaged reactors.&lt;ref&gt;NHK=world ( 4 April 2012) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/20120404_09.html Reconstruction minister suggests no-return zone]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 30, 2013, "a wide area around" the Fukushima nuclear plant continues to show radiation contamination above 50 millisieverts, and that includes 96% of the town of Futaba where all of its 6,520 residents were evacuated.&lt;ref&gt;http://fukushimaupdate.com/last-no-go-zone-designation-in-fukushima-lifted/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evacuation zone partially lifted===
On 1 April 2012 the evacuation orders for the villages [[Kawauchi, Fukushima|Kawauchi]] and [[Tamura, Fukushima|Tamura]] were lifted, on 15 April the people of [[Minamisoma, Fukushima|Minamisoma]] were able to return to their homes. A ceremony was held for police and volunteers, who were to patrol the borders of the no-go areas. The checkpoints 20 kilometers from the reactors were moved to about 10 kilometers. Three new evacuation zones were planned by the government in areas within 11 villages and towns according to radiation levels.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-World (16 April 2012) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/society.html Govt. lifts evacuation order for Minamisoma City] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127083730/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/society.html |date=2012-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The small city of Minamisoma was divided into 3 zones, in the first people were free to go in and out, in the second access is limited, the third area all visiting is forbidden. Still scattered with ruins, and with no electricity and running water, the city was a rather uninhabitable place for a population formed by mostly elderly people. Schools and hospitals remained closed.&lt;ref&gt;The Japan Times (Tuesday, April 17, 2012) [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120417a2.html Evacuation order lifted for parts of Minamisoma]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 April 2012 a meeting was organised by the Japanese government to inform the people of [[Naraha, Fukushima]] about the wish to lift the evacuation order for the city of Naraha. Almost all territory of Naraha was situated within the 20 kilometer zone, and the people would be able to return to their former homes, because local maximum radiation doses would be 20 millisieverts per year. Deputy head of the Cabinet's Nuclear Emergency Response Headquarters Kensuke Tomita, who represented the government at the meeting, was overwhelmed by all the questions and angry remarks of the local people attending the meeting. At the end he promised that: "TEPCO and the government will take responsibility for restoring local infrastructure, decontamination and (nuclear disaster) compensation." But at this moment the city government had given up the possibility for re-designation before March. On 16 April the governor of Fukushima Yuhei Sato said at the Nuclear Emergency Response Headquarters, that the people of Fukushima were frightened by all the problems with the nuclear plant, and persisted that the government would take control.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (18 April 2012) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120418p2a00m0na014000c.html Official 'decommissioning' of Fukushima reactors brings locals no peace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420230050/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120418p2a00m0na014000c.html |date=2012-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decontamination==
On 23 June 2013 during a meeting with evacuees from the Miyakoji district of Tamura, Fukushima Prefecture and central government officials, the announcement was made that the residents would be allowed to return to their homes in mid-August 2013, although the radiation levels in residential areas still ranged between 0.32 and 0.54 microsieverts per hour, much higher than the government's goal of 0.23 microsieverts per hour. However, decontamination efforts in the Miyakoji district were declared completed. When asked, the officials refused to prolong the decontamination efforts, arguing that exposure to radiation would differ for every person. The 0.23 microsievert per hour limit would lead to an accumulated radiation exposure exceeding 1 millisievert for people that would stay outdoors for eight hours a day. Instead the officials offered the evacuees a new type of dosimeter so that they could check their own radiation exposures, and in this way take responsibility for their own safety.
Although billions of yen were spent in an effort to decontaminate some areas around the troubled nuclear plant, the effort was described as futile, and radioactive waste was not collected properly and disposed of, and sometimes dumped into rivers.&lt;ref&gt;The Asahi Shimbun (23 March 2013)[http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201303230057 Fukushima cleanup contractors told workers to lie about pay in 'surprise' inspections] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125234952/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201303230057 |date=2014-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mainich Shimbun (08 June 2013) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130608p2a00m0na012000c.html Data reveals that 75 percent of decontamination work in housing areas remains unfinished] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130701085851/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130608p2a00m0na012000c.html |date=2013-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (27 May 2013) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130527p2a00m0na009000c.html Subcontractor chided for sacking Fukushima decontamination work whistle-blowers] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130701085854/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130527p2a00m0na009000c.html |date=2013-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tomohiko Hideta, an official of the Reconstruction Agency, said that it would be impossible to reach the official targets, and confirmed the offer of the dosimeters. However, spokesmen for the Japanese Ministry of Environment denied all, even when they were confronted with the existence of audio recordings of the meeting that proved otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;The Asahi Shimbun (29 June 2013) [http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201306290074 Government offers dosimeters—not decontamination—for Fukushima evacuees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105103945/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201306290074 |date=2015-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monitoring the impact of radiation-exposure on the health of residents==
On 4 November 2011 in the city of [[Hamamatsu]], Goshi Hosono, minister in charge of the nuclear crisis, made a remark about plans to set up a study regarding the health consequences of radiation levels of about 20 millisieverts per year. Studies done after nuclear accidents in the past suggested that radiation levels of more than 100 millisieverts at once would have negative effects on human health, but negative effects from lower levels were never found. The Japanese government hoped to be able to accept 20 millisieverts per year as below the limit harmful to human health. This exposure limit is recommended by the International Commission for Radiological Protection. Concerning the government project of disposing of debris in areas outside northeastern Japan, Hosono said that rubble from [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]] and [[Miyagi Prefecture|Miyagi]] was not radioactive, burning the rubble was harmless, and the ashes would be disposed of safely. Local governments would be asked for cooperation, with the national government ensuring safety and taking overall responsibility .&lt;ref&gt;NHK-World (5 November 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/05_26.html Govt to study low-level radiation impact] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108235348/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/05_26.html |date=2011-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (6 November 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1320550190P.pdf Earthquake-report 257: Govt to study low-level radiation impact] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517063935/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1320550190P.pdf |date=2013-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 December the Ministry of Environment announced an extra program to monitor the impact of radiation exposure on children born to mothers in Fukushima Prefecture, to find links between the mothers' radiation exposure and congenital abnormalities, asthma, allergies or other diseases of their children. The checks would stop when the children reach the age of 13.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (21 December 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1324452150P.pdf Earthquake-report 297: NHK-world: Radiation impact on Fukushima kids to be monitored] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103113253/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1324452150P.pdf |date=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No health effects of this nature are expected to rise as a result of the incident.

On 15 April 2012 the city of [[Namie, Fukushima]] asked the Japanese government for free healthcare for its residents. To monitor long-term health, the city would provide to all inhabitants health handbooks, in order to keep a thorough record of all health checks and thyroid examinations. The health books followed the structure of those used to monitor the health of the atomic bomb survivors in [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]]. These "[[hibakusha]]" health books were free from medical fees, and Namie asked the government to set up a similar program for the people in Namie. Of the seven other cities around the nuclear plant, Futaba was also willing to take part in this program.&lt;ref&gt;The Japan Times (15 April 2012) [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120415a3.html Namie to seek medical fee exemption for all residents]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012 the government of the evacuated city of Namie bought a whole-body dosimeter. The device was installed in a temporary housing in [[Nihonmatsu, Fukushima]], in order to monitor the internal radiation exposure and the health of the citizens of Namie. Some 50 people a day could be examined, a complete screening would take two minutes per person. Initial screenings of the whole population was planned to be finished at the end of the fiscal year 2012. In this way the government of Namie wanted to offer a long-term monitoring program to the population. Another reason for this was excessive exposure to radiation during the first days directly after the nuclear disaster in March 2011, when predictions from SPEEDI were ignored by the Fukushima Prefectural government.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (26 April 2012) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120426p2a00m0na011000c.html Evacuated Fukushima town sets up whole-body dosimeter at temporary housing complex] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428172025/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120426p2a00m0na011000c.html |date=2012-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 2013 12 children were diagnosed with thyroid cancer, and 15 others were suspected of having the disease. Four members of the panel that accompanied the screening stepped down that day. Among the new members were Shuji Shimizu, professor at Fukushima University (involved with nuclear-related payouts) and Shinji Tokonami, professor at Hirosaki University, who had done the health screening in the town of Namie. In an attempt to regain public trust, after it became known that secret meetings were held to "harmonize the opinions of the panel-members". In addition the panel said that its goal had been changed from "alleviating the anxiety of the residents" to "maintaining and promoting the health of prefectural residents into the future." Because this was the first large-scale survey in this field, comparisons could not made. The government of Fukushima Prefecture provided the results of the testing and a list of the patients to the panel, which it had previously refused to do in order to protect the privacy of the patients.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (06 June 2013)[http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130606p2a00m0na013000c.html 4 members leave Fukushima panel overseeing prefectural health survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010711/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130606p2a00m0na013000c.html |date=2013-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Asahi Shimbun (06 June 2013)[http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201306060092 Experts: More data needed to assess radiation's role in cancer among Fukushima kids] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612230326/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201306060092 |date=2013-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing school lunches==
On the end of March 2012 a survey of [[Kyodo News]] revealed that fears for contamination with radioactive fallout 44 of 74 major towns in Japan were testing school lunches or food-components for radioactive cesium. In eastern Japan a majority of 34 out of 42 towns had started with these tests, after the government had ordered testing in 17 prefectures around the Fukushima-plant.

In other parts of Japan, testing was left free to decide whether to test school lunches. But
already 10 out of 32 towns had implemented similar tests, while at this date [[Morioka]], [[Akita, Akita|Akita]] and four other towns had plans to start testing. Some cities did not test themselves, they relied on the safety of the food because pre-shipment tests conducted by producers.

Although after 1 April 2012 the Japanese government lowered the legal standard for radioactive cesium-levels down to 100 becquerels/kg, some cities decided to lower the standard even further:

* no detection : [[Tottori, Tottori|Tottori]]
* 4 becquerels/kg: [[Sapporo]]
* 10 becquerels/kg:[[Yamagata, Yamagata|Yamagata]]
* 40 becquerels/kg: [[Fukui, Fukui|Fukui]], [[Adachi, Tokyo|Adachi]], [[Sumida, Tokyo|Sumida]]
* 50 becquerels/kg: [[Kyoto]]

Other towns like [[Fukushima, Fukushima|Fukushima]], [[Matsuyama]] and the Bunkyo Ward school in Tokyo planned to demand for lower than legal levels.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (29 March 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120329p2g00m0dm006000c.html 44 Japanese municipalities test school lunches for cesium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330122005/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120329p2g00m0dm006000c.html |date=2012-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stress-tests==
On 8 November the Japanese government published the first results of nuclear safety tests at the website of [[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency|NISA]]. This was done to boost transparency before laid-off reactors were restarted. The minister of industry Yukio Edano asked the public to respond with remarks and questions about the tests, and promised to respond to this all. He hoped, that this would lead to a better understanding of the nuclear safety procedures.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (8 November 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/08_18.html Govt releases nuclear safety test results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903050208/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/08_18.html |date=2011-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debris disposal==
Nine months after the disaster of 11 March it proved increasingly difficult to dispose all the debris and rubble. In April 572 municipalities were willing to accept the debris, but in the latest survey done by the Ministry of Environment on 7 October only 54 municipalities in 11 prefectures were willing to consider acceptance, and only six places had already taken in parts of the debris. Fear for radioactive contamination was thought to be the cause for this. The ministry declined to identify the municipalities that have agreed, or refused, to accept the debris. Some 4.88 million tons of rubble were needed to be disposed of a year after the quake. Around 20.5 million tons was collected in Iwate and Miyagi, all was stored at multiple temporary storage sites. The debris from Fukushima would be stored within this prefecture. On 2 November 30 tons of debris was loaded on train, and sent to Tokyo by rail from the city of Miyako, Iwate. The first train carrying the debris would arrive in Tokyo on 4 November. This made Tokyo the first local government outside Japan's northeast to accept debris.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (3 November 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/national/archive/news/2011/11/03/20111103p2g00m0dm016000c.html Municipalities increasingly unwilling to accept quake debris] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120711012217/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/national/archive/news/2011/11/03/20111103p2g00m0dm016000c.html |date=2012-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (3 November 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1320374709P.pdf Earthquake-report 255] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103124954/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1320374709P.pdf |date=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interim Storage facility===
On 28 December at a meeting in the city of Fukushima minister Goshi Hosono asked the local leaders of prefecture Fukushima for permission to build an interim storage facility somewhere in the county of [[Futaba District, Fukushima|Futaba]] near the two villages hosting the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.

Local residents, however, were seriously divided. Those who would like to return to their houses, were afraid, that an interim-storage might prove to be a very permanent storage, and would make any return impossible. But others had already accepted the fact, that the radiation-levels around their former houses would be too high, and would make living there impractical for a long time. Some local residents realized that without the interim storage facility, there would no place to dispose radioactive waste at all, and the construction of the facility would create also new jobs.

Local leaders were willing to accept the new waste-storage, but in the mean time they were reluctant, because the anger of some of their citizens and the fact that the presence of it, could hamper all efforts to decontaminate the area and would make repopulation impossible. Therefor they requested an insurance from the government, that the storage would be closed after 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily news (29 December 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111229p2a00m0na004000c.html Gov't request for nuclear storage facility site sends shockwaves through Fukushima] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229185933/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111229p2a00m0na004000c.html |date=2011-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (29 December 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1325129913P.pdf earthquake report 303: Govt requests sites for waste soil storage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103155038/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1325129913P.pdf |date=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public reaction==
The news of the contamination of foods with radioactive substances leaking from the Fukushima nuclear reactors damaged the mutual trust between local food producers including farmers and consumers. Everywhere in Japan banners and stickers were found with: "Hang in there, Fukushima!", numerous harmful rumors on Fukushima products could be found online. Many rumors that were discriminatory to Fukushima and other messages slandering Fukushima people could be found on the Internet. The source of cesium was found to be rice straw that had been feed to the animal. But a notice of the Japanese government that was sent to cattle-farmers after the nuclear accident made no mention to the possibility that rice straw could be contaminated with radioactive materials from the plant.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News( 25 October 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/perspectives/news/20111025p2a00m0na005000c.html Nuclear plant accidents threaten relations between food producers and consumers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026193240/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/perspectives/news/20111025p2a00m0na005000c.html |date=2011-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media coverage of the event has been described as taking an "irrational approach which generated the worst of humanity" because many anti-nuclear groups tried to make political points out of the issue. In addition, the main story should have been on the 19,000 people killed by the tsunami and the thousands of missing individuals. However, public attention was drawn ''away'' from the needs of major restructuring, housing, developing the transportation system, and helping people who suffered because of the tsunami.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moderntokyotimes.com/2012/03/02/fukushima-nuclear-accident-the-media-and-international-responses/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313194222/http://moderntokyotimes.com/2012/03/02/fukushima-nuclear-accident-the-media-and-international-responses/ |date=March 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, a study by Nakamura "found a continued willingness to participate in social learning processes and in citizen deliberations that may have been triggered by the 2011 disaster" and which "apparently contradicts the evidence of a decaying psychological half-life of Fukushima memories observed in TV programmes." &lt;ref name="Nakamura 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nakamura |first1=Hidenori |date=October 2018 |title=Six years after: ‘Fukushima memories’ and continued willingness to participate in energy and environmental policy-making process in Japan |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/18692729.2018.1543244 |journal=Contemporary Japan |volume=31 |issue=1 |doi=10.1080/18692729.2018.1543244 |accessdate=December 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial actions against restarting nuclear powerplants==
In August 2011 citizens of the prefecture [[Shiga]], at the banks of Lake [[Biwa]], started a lawsuit at the Otsu District Court, and asked a court order to prevent the restart of seven reactors operated by [[Kansai Electric Power Company]], in the prefecture [[Fukui Prefecture|Fukui]].

On 8 November 2011 a group of 40 citizens of [[Ōtsu, Shiga|Otsu]] prefecture [[Kyodo]] started a similar lawsuit at the Otsu District Court against [[Japan Atomic Power Company]]. They asked for a provisional court order to delay the restart of the two reactors at the [[Tsuruga Nuclear Power Plant]] in the city of [[Tsuruga]]. The plaintiffs argued that:

* Lake [[Biwa]] could be contaminated when a nuclear accident would occur at the plant
* The whole region of Kansai is dependent on this, the biggest lake of Japan, because it is the source of drinking water for the whole region
* an accident would endanger the health of all residents
* the Tsuruga plant is built on a site with a fault below it and a severe accident could occur during an earthquake
* the No. 1 reactor had been more than 40 years in service since it was first operational in 1970, and the Tsuruga plant was insufficiently protected against tsunamis.
* the ongoing regular checks were done under the government's safety and technological standards, and the nuclear crisis in Fukushima had proven that those regulations were insufficient.
* the reactors should remain shut down until the cause of the disaster in Fukushima would be fully investigated
* the regular checks should be performed under the new safety standards.

The operator of the plant did not want to make any comment to the press. At that time the two reactors of the plant were shut down for regular checkups. But the four-month inspection of the No. 2 reactor could be completed in December, and the checkup of reactor 1 could be completed in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (9 November 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111109p2g00m0dm007000c.html Residents seek court order not to restart Tsuruga reactors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112080134/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111109p2g00m0dm007000c.html |date=2011-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 December 2011 a lawsuit was started against [[Kyūshū Electric Power Company]] by 290 local residents. Most of them living in the prefectures [[Saga Prefecture|Saga]] and [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]]. They said that the disaster in Fukushima had made it clear, that an accident at the Genkai-plant caused by a possible earthquake or tsunami could damage the lives and health of the people living nearby. They questioned in particular the safety of the 36-year-old nr. 1 reactor near the sea. Kyushu Electric commented, that it would examine the suit and would act "appropriately." This was already the third time that locals tried to stop this plant. Because in July 2011 90 people asked the local court for an injunction order to stop the nr. 2 and nr. 3 Genkai-reactors from going back online, like was done in August 2010 when about 130 local residents and others demanded from the district court to halt to the use of plutonium-uranium mixed oxide fuel, or MOX, at the No. 3 Genkai-reactor.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (28 December 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111228p2g00m0dm015000c.html Residents sue to seek complete suspension of Genkai reactors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104032224/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111228p2g00m0dm015000c.html |date=2012-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012 a lawsuit was filed against the Japanese government and Kyushu Electric Power Co. at the Saga District Court by about 1,700 people from all over Japan. The complaint mentioned that after the Fukushima disaster the safety myth regarding nuclear reactors was proven to be false, and under the Japanese Constitution everybody in Japan should live without fear. On 12 March 2012 the total of people complaining was already more than 3000, when 1370 people joined the plaintiffs. Another group was planning to file another suit to seek suspension of yet another nuclear power plant run by the same company. According to Akira Hasegawa, the leader of the plaintiffs and former president of Saga University it looked possible to him raising the number of plaintiffs to 10.000.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (13 March 2012) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120313p2g00m0dm027000c.html Lawsuit seeking to halt Genkai atomic plant draws record plaintiffs] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120711103128/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120313p2g00m0dm027000c.html |date=2012-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal charges against NISA, NSA and TEPCO===
On 14 March 2012 two groups of citizens had taken up the plan to file criminal complaints against officials of TEPCO and governmental agencies for professional negligence in the Fukushima nuclear disaster. On 9 March in the town of Iwaki they had held a demonstration to mobilize at least 1000 people in the area of Fukushima to join in, because round 15 May the complaint would be filed at the office of the Fukushima District Public Prosecutors. In this complaint officials of the governmental Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan, [[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency|NISA]] and TEPCO would be accused of criminal conduct and neglect resulting in the failure to prevent the nuclear crisis.

As a result, many people were exposed to radiation, patients dies because they needed to flee from their hospital, The group considered to accuse the officials of imposing health hazards through the spread of massive amounts of radioactive substances.

The 58-year-old member of the Iwaki municipal assembly and leader of the group, Kazuyoshi Sato said, he believed it was "nonsense that nobody has been held criminally responsible for causing a major nuclear accident. I'd like to call on as many Fukushima people as possible, including those who are taking shelter in areas outside of the prefecture, to join our action."

According to lawyer Yukuo Yasuda in the complaint TEPCO would be charged for not taking all necessary precautions against a possible tsunami, although studies had pointed out that there had been this kind of tsunamis in this region in the past. NISA and NSA were accused of neglect because they did not instruct TEPCO to implement the necessary measures.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (15 March 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120315p2g00m0dm010000c.html Fukushima citizens to accuse TEPCO, state of negligence over crisis]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal investigations==
On 22 May 2012 the 33-year-old Makoto Owada, a high-ranking gang-member of the Sumiyoshi-kai yakuza group was arrested. Workers supplied by a network of companies and subcontractors were forced to pay substantial portions of their earnings to the subcontracting companies and Owada. Investigators learned that already in 2007 Owada was dispatching workers at the nuclear power plant construction sites in various areas.

==Scientific reaction==
On 25 October 2011 the university of [[Hiroshima]] disclosed a plan to train the staff of the Japan Red Cross staff in how to respond to nuclear disasters like the one in Fukushima. The papers were to be signed on 26 October 2011. The president Toshimasa Asahara of the University said, he hoped that the university staff would also learn from the experience of the Red Cross in the care for disaster-disasters, including those in other countries. The University of Hiroshima University did establish a leading research center into the effects of radiation on the human body and health: the [[Research Institute for Radiation, Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima|Research Institute for Radiation, Biology and Medicine]], due to decades lasting studies after the effects on local population, that survived the atomic-explosion of Hiroshima in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (26 October 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111026p2g00m0dm011000c.html Hiroshima Univ., Red Cross to cooperate in radiation, disaster fields] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030024453/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111026p2g00m0dm011000c.html |date=2011-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fukushima accident exposed some troubling nuclear safety issues:&lt;ref name=Sci11/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Despite the resources poured into analyzing crustal movements and having expert committees determine earthquake risk, for instance, researchers never considered the possibility of a magnitude-9 earthquake followed by a massive tsunami. The failure of multiple safety features on nuclear power plants has raised questions about the nation's engineering prowess. Government flip-flopping on acceptable levels of radiation exposure confused the public, and health professionals provided little guidance. Facing a dearth of reliable information on radiation levels, citizens armed themselves with dosimeters, pooled data, and together produced radiological contamination maps far more detailed than anything the government or official scientific sources ever provided.&lt;ref name=Sci11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/11/in-wake-of-fukushima-disaster.html |title=In Wake of Fukushima Disaster, Japan's Scientists Ponder How to Regain Public Trust |author=Dennis Normile |date=28 November 2011 |work=Science |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128195939/http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/11/in-wake-of-fukushima-disaster.html |archivedate=28 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
On 9 November 2011 the ministry of Finance reported that since the disaster in March 2011, due to rising energy costs, high oil-prices, and the need to replace the loss of nuclear power the current account surplus had fallen 21.4 percent to 20.4 billion dollars compared with the year 2010. A decline of seven months in-a-row. The trade balance had also fallen by 59 percent year-on-year to a surplus of about 4.8 billion dollars. The strong yen made the export of electronic components difficult. Through higher returns on overseas investments, however, the income account surplus rose 12.9 percent to nearly 18 billion dollars. Compared with 2010 the balance of international payments had shrunk 46.8 percent.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (9 November 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/09_20.html Japan's current account surplus continue to shrink] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104060131/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/09_20.html |date=2011-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Japan saw a fall in manufacturing output for 2011, there was an increased use of fossil fuels for power generation, and this was the main driving force behind a rise in Japanese greenhouse gas emissions. Ministry of the Environment figures for 2011 show total greenhouse gas emissions of 1300 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent – 49 million tonnes more than in 2010 (a 3.9% increase).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/EE-Japan_sees_emissions_rise-1012127.html Japan sees emissions rise].

==Technical developments==
On 29 March 2012 a prototype of a new camera was presented by [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA) and the [[Japan Atomic Energy Agency]] (JAEA) for the detection of gamma radiation. Images were made with a wide angle lens, the amount of contamination was presented in six different colors, the highest concentrations were red, after this yellow, green and purple. The camera was tested in February on different locations in Fukushima, the very accurate images of the contamination had already proven it effectiveness in the decontamination effort.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (29 March 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120329p2a00m0na006000c.html JAXA develops camera that can 'see' radioactive contamination] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331172541/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120329p2a00m0na006000c.html |date=2012-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compensation payments==

===The Nuclear Damage Liability Facilitation Fund===
On 21 October the president of TEPCO Toshio Nishizawa said that his company hoped to avoid capital injections from the [[Nuclear Damage Liability Facilitation Fund]], a foundation of the Japanese government. TEPCO would need financial aid from this fund to be able to pay the huge compensation payments due to the nuclear disaster at its Fukushima nuclear power plants.  At a press-conference in Tokyo Nishizawa made the following remarks:

"We would like to properly conduct compensation by receiving financial assistance, while also taking rationalization measures to turn around management and keep on going as a private company, I think it's the best option for all to avoid capital injection as much as possible."

TEPCO might claim in October 2011 the sum of 120 billion yen of government compensation for the nuclear accident, this is the maximum amount set by a contract between the government and TEPCO. Compensation payments to people and companies that suffered damages through the crisis at that date already exceeded 150 billion yen. These compensation payments could rise up to 4.54 trillion yen (4,500,000,000,000 yen or around 59 billion US dollar) by March 2013, as was revealed by a report made by a commission of the Japanese government According to an estimate by a report compiled by a government panel, compensation payments could reach 4.54 trillion yen by March 2013. Special Government bonds, that carry no interest but could be cashed when necessary, would raise the money needed.  The fund has also the right to make capital injections to TEPCO by subscribing shares. In close cooperation with this fund Tepco tried to seek financial backup for the future.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (22 October 2011)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111022p2g00m0dm012000c.html TEPCO to make efforts to avoid capital injection: Nishizawa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022184308/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111022p2g00m0dm012000c.html |date=2011-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At January 2013 TEPCO announced, that it needed more money to be able to pay compensations to the victims. At that moment the cost were estimated at Y3.24 trillion ($38 billion), up Y697 billion since March 2012, when the last calculation was made. In October 2011, seven months after the disaster the first assumption had been Y1.1 trillion. Since then, TEPCO already received Y1.5 billion financial aid, but the cost tripled. Besides the compensation costs, TEPCO would need some Y10 trillion to dismantle the reactors and clean up the radioactive polluted areas.&lt;ref&gt;The Tokyo Times (04 January 2013) [http://www.tokyotimes.com/2013/fukushima-operator-needs-more-money-to-compensate-victims/ Fukushima operator needs more money to compensate victims]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compensation criteria for former residents of the evacuation zones===
In February 2012 new restitution standards were set by the Japanese government center for settling disputes over compensation for nuclear accidents for the ongoing Fukushima nuclear crisis:

TEPCO was ordered to pay:

* to every person that was told to leave their home in accordance with official evacuation advisories.
** 100,000 yen per month
** after 7 months this amount should not be halved, as initially was planned.
* to all people that evacuated on their own initiative:
** the costs of transportation
** the costs of accommodation expenses in excess of the amounts listed by the interim guidelines set by the government's Dispute Reconciliation Committee for Nuclear Damage
*** 400,000 yen for children and expecting mothers
*** 80,000 yen for all others.

TEPCO is also required to pay compensation for any damage caused by the nuclear disaster to properties in evacuation zones, even without on-site checks to confirm the properties' conditions.

The government of prefecture Fukushima was notified that in some areas the former residents would not be permitted to return, because there was no prospect that decontamination could be completed in any foreseeable future.

Settling the claims filed by evacuees about compensation, proved to be very difficult. Because TEPCO did refuse to respond to victims' claims, that their residences and other properties were worthless after the crisis. From 900 claims filed less than 10 claims were settled at the end of February 2012, despite all efforts of more than 150 lawyers, mediators and inspectors.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (25 February 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/perspectives/news/20120225p2a00m0na001000c.html TEPCO must be proactive in nuke crisis compensation negotiations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225172019/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/perspectives/news/20120225p2a00m0na001000c.html |date=2012-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, tort law and "compensation theories which have been developed by handling traffic accidents are to be used as reference to a relatively large degree" in assessing compensation for evacuees, which has been criticized for not adequately meeting the degree of pain and suffering caused. In response, some legal analysts have suggested that new categories of compensation including "the ‘loss of home and hometown’ (furusato sōshitsu) and the ‘fear of being contaminated by radiation’ (hōshasen hibaku no kyōfu)" should be recognized. &lt;ref name="Kawamura 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kawamura |first1=Hiroki |date=March 2018 |title=The relation between law and technology in Japan: liability for technology-related mass damage in the cases of Minamata disease, asbestos, and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/18692729.2018.1423459 |journal=Contemporary Japan |volume=30 |issue=1 |doi=10.1080/18692729.2018.142345 |accessdate=December 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compensation criteria for the tourist industry===
On 26 October 2011 TEPCO revised its criteria in calculating the damage suffered by tourist businesses after the crisis. Initial calculations by TEPCO included a deduction of 20 percent of the calculated losses. In the first announcement on 21 September 2011 TEPCO said that this 20 percent was thought to be caused not by radiation fears, but through the impact of the earthquake and the tsunami that followed. The new criteria offered two options:
* 10 percent reduction, no limit to the period.
* 20 percent reduction, but the period is shortened to 31 May 2011, between the first of June and 31 August the rate would be zero. The first criteria were based on data on the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake that hit Kobe and surrounding area, this provoked much opposition.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (27 October 2011 )[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111027p2g00m0dm006000c.html TEPCO revises compensation criteria for tourism businesses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030024504/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111027p2g00m0dm006000c.html |date=2011-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternate energy sources ==
=== Renewable energy ===
In September 2011, [[Tetsunari Iida]] launched the Japan Renewable Energy Foundation, which is backed by ¥1 billion (US$13 million) from Japan's richest man, [[Masayoshi Son]]. The foundation will bring together some 100 experts from around the world to analyse obstacles to [[Renewable energy commercialization|implementing renewable energy]], and offer policy recommendations to the new Japanese government.&lt;ref name=renew&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110830/full/477013a.html |title=Japan's new leader faces energy gap  |author=David Cyranoski |date=Vol. 477, No. 13-14 (2011)  |work=Nature }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coal ===
The drop in energy capacity as a result of the partial shutdown of nuclear power plants has prompted the [[Shinzō Abe]]-led government to revisit the use of coal for energy generation, primarily through the increased adoption of high energy, low emissions (HELE) power plants that employ [[coal pollution mitigation]] techniques. By 2015, the share of coal in Japan's power sector had risen to 31% from 23% prior to the Fukushima disaster, but is projected by the government to fall to 26% by 2030 as Japan's energy mix stabilizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Japan plans to build 45 new coal power plants in next decade: EIA |url=http://www.platts.com/latest-news/coal/sydney/japan-plans-to-build-45-new-coal-power-plants-27762428 |accessdate=23 February 2017 |newspaper=S&amp;P Global Platts |date=3 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fukushima nuclear accident]] "cannot be regarded as a natural disaster," the NAIIC panel's chairman, Tokyo University professor emeritus [[Kiyoshi Kurokawa]], wrote in the inquiry report. "It was a profoundly man-made disaster -- that could and should have been foreseen and prevented.

In addition, the Commission recognized that the affected residents are still struggling and facing grave concerns, including the "health effects of radiation exposure, displacement, the dissolution of families, disruption of their lives and lifestyles and the contamination of vast areas of the environment". The decontamination and restoration activities, essential for rebuilding communities, will continue into the long term. 

== General ==

The nuclear incident was the result of poor earthquake-safety planning and faulty post-tsunami communication.&lt;ref name="WP20120705W"&gt;{{cite news|last=Harlan|first=Chico|title=Report blasts Japan’s preparation for, response to Fukushima disaster|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/new-report-blasts-japans-preparation-for-response-to-fukushima-disaster/2012/07/05/gJQAN1OEPW_story.html|accessdate=9 July 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of collusion between the facility's operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO), regulators and the Japanese government the nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant unfolded as a "man-made disaster".&lt;ref name="CNN20120705"&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese parliament report: Fukushima nuclear crisis was 'man-made'|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/05/world/asia/japan-fukushima-report/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=9 July 2012|author=Yoko Wakatsuki and Jethro Mullen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report attributed the cause of the failings to Japan's culture of "reflexive obedience", noted that there was no separation between atomic regulation and promotion and described a Japan in which nuclear power became "an unstoppable force, immune to scrutiny by civil society."&lt;ref name="CNN20120705" /&gt; TEPCO, regulators and the government "failed to correctly develop the most basic safety requirements -- such as assessing the probability of damage, preparing for containing collateral damage from such a disaster, and developing evacuation plans," the NAIIC said. According to the report the lack of training and knowledge of the TEPCO workers  at the facility reduced the effectiveness of the response to the situation at a critical time following the quake and tsunami. As the crisis escalated, TEPCO, the regulators, government agencies and the prime minister's office were ineffective in "preventing or limiting the consequential damage" at Fukushima Daiichi.&lt;ref name="CNN20120705" /&gt; 

"According to this commission's study, on March 11, it is believed that the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was in a vulnerable condition with no guarantee it could withstand earthquakes and tsunamis," the report said.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120705" /&gt; The government and plant operator TEPCO have been unwilling to say the reactors could have been damaged by the initial earthquake.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120705" /&gt; An earlier report by TEPCO had all but cleared the huge utility, saying the size of the earthquake and tsunami was beyond all expectations and could not reasonably have been foreseen. But the report of the commission said: "Despite having a number of opportunities to take measures, regulatory agencies and TEPCO management deliberately postponed decisions, did not take action or took decisions that were convenient for themselves."&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120705" /&gt; It also said that had the company had its way, its staff would have been evacuated from the crippled plant and the catastrophe could have spiralled even further out of control.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120705" /&gt;

According to the New York Times the report criticized Tepco as being too quick to dismiss earthquake damage as a cause of the fuel meltdowns at three of the plant’s six reactors, which overheated when the site lost power. Tepco has contended that the plant withstood the earthquake that rocked eastern Japan, instead placing blame for the disaster on what some experts have called a “once in a millennium” tsunami that followed. Such a rare calamity was beyond the scope of contingency planning, Tepco executives have suggested, and was unlikely to pose a threat to Japan’s other nuclear reactors in the foreseeable future.&lt;ref name="NYT20120705"&gt;{{cite news|title=Inquiry Declares Fukushima Crisis a Man-Made Disaster|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/06/world/asia/fukushima-nuclear-crisis-a-man-made-disaster-report-says.html?_r=2|accessdate=9 July 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=5 July 2012|author=Hiroko Tabuchi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parliamentary report suggests according to the New York Times that Reactor No. 1, in particular, might have suffered earthquake damage, including the possibility that pipes burst from the shaking, leading to a loss of coolant even before the tsunami hit the plant about 30 minutes after the initial earthquake. The report emphasized that a full assessment would require better access to the inner workings of the reactors, which may not be possible for years.&lt;ref name="NYT20120705" /&gt; “However,” the report said, “it is impossible to limit the direct cause of the accident to the tsunami without substantive evidence. The commission believes that this is an attempt to avoid responsibility by putting all the blame on the unexpected (the tsunami),” the report continued, adding, “and not on the more foreseeable quake.”&lt;ref name="NYT20120705" /&gt; 

The commission accused the Japanese government, Tepco and nuclear regulators of failing to carry out basic safety measures despite being aware of the risks posed by earthquakes, tsunamis and other events that might cut off power systems. Even though the government-appointed Nuclear Safety Commission revised earthquake resistance standards in 2006 and ordered nuclear operators around the country to inspect their reactors, for example, Tepco did not carry out any checks, and regulators did not follow up, the report said. Tepco “manipulated its cozy relationship with regulators to take the teeth out of regulations,” the report said.&lt;ref name="NYT20120705" /&gt; 

Nuclear power plants should have been made more quake-proof, but Japan's nuclear bloc, while reassuring the nation about its safe atomic plants, ignored safeguards that would have helped strengthen the Fukushima facility against a massive, but foreseeable earthquake.&lt;ref name="WP20120705W" /&gt; The Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) did not press Tepco to prepare for a so-called full station blackout — the loss of main and backup power — because the “probability was small.” NISA instead asked Tepco to explain why new prevention measures would not be necessary.&lt;ref name="WP20120705W" /&gt; Regulators and nuclear operators went to painstaking lengths to ignore safety risks at the plant or cover them up.&lt;ref name="WP20120705W" /&gt; They disregarded earlier warnings from outside watchdog groups that earthquakes posed a significant safety risk to the nuclear plants, and by doing so they “effectively betrayed the nation’s right to be safe from nuclear accidents.”&lt;ref name="WP20120705W" /&gt; The report said "it is considered that TEPCO management knew about delays in anti-quake works and postponement of tsunami measures and were aware that the Fukushima Daiichi was vulnerable".
TEPCO also failed to act promptly, the panel concluded, but added: "This should not be attributed to individuals … at the plant but the structural problems of TEPCO."&lt;ref name="SMH20120706" /&gt; The NAIIC blamed lax safety measures on what it called the country’s powerful and “collusive” decision-makers and on a conformist culture that allowed them to operate with little scrutiny.&lt;ref name="WP20120705W" /&gt; “What must be admitted — very painfully — is that this was a disaster ‘Made in Japan,’” investigation chairman Kiyoshi Kurokawa wrote in the introduction to the report. “Its fundamental causes are to be found in the ingrained conventions of Japanese culture: our reflexive obedience; our reluctance to question authority; our devotion to ‘sticking with the program’; our groupism; and our insularity.”&lt;ref name="WP20120705W" /&gt;

[[Command hierarchy|Chain of command]] were disrupted amid the crisis which created confusion, while communication failures about critical decisions undermined trust between the different parties.&lt;ref name="CNN20120705" /&gt; The prime minister’s office waited too long to declare a state of emergency. TEPCO’s disaster-response manuals were out of date, missed key diagrams, while TEPCO was too slow to relay information to the government.&lt;ref name="WP20120705W" /&gt; The administration of then prime minister [[Naoto Kan]] hampered operations as the disaster unfolded, the report said, and did not use a logical chain of command. "The prime minister's office was supposed to contact the plant operator through an on-the-spot task force. But … issued direct instructions to TEPCO head office and the accident site, confusing the command line."&lt;ref name="SMH20120706" /&gt; Then-Prime Minister Naoto Kan traveled to the plant mid-meltdown and “diverted the attention and time of the on-site operational staff and confused the line of command,” the report said. “Had the head office of Tepco actively communicated the on-site situation from the start, and explained the severity of the situation to the other parties,” the report said, “there is a possibility that the distrust — and the confusion in the chain of command that followed — could have been prevented.”&lt;ref name="WP20120705W" /&gt;

==Commission Recommendations==

The NAIIC made a series of recommendations to try to avoid a repeat of the catastrophe. Japan needs to overhaul its nuclear regulation system by creating an independent watchdog, because the nuclear safety agency was a part of the same government ministry that promoted nuclear power.&lt;ref name="WP20120705W" /&gt; The commission recommended that the Diet establish a permanent, parliamentary oversight panel to deal with nuclear power and supervise regulators and to ensure that the government and utilities carry out the necessary measures to prevent any recurrence of the Fukushima disaster.&lt;ref name="CNN20120705" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes20120705"&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan leaders, utility slammed for 'man-made' nuclear disaster|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/07/panel-slams-tokyo-government-utility-for-manmade-nuclear-disaster.html|accessdate=9 July 2012|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "fundamental re-examination of the crisis management system" was suggested. The report also called for measures tackling public health and welfare issues, including the establishment of a system "to deal with long-term public health effects," monitoring "hot spots" and "the spread of radioactive contamination", and for starting "a detailed and transparent program of decontamination and relocation." In addition a system of independent investigation commissions dealing with nuclear issues should be developed.&lt;ref name="CNN20120705" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan panel: Fukushima nuclear disaster 'man-made'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18718057|publisher=BBC News Asia|accessdate=9 July 2012|date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings published by NAIIC call for further investigation of the impact of the 9.0 magnitude earthquake - as opposed to the towering tsunami - on the reactors at Fukushima.&lt;ref name="SMH20120706"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fukushima disaster 'man-made'|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/fukushima-disaster-manmade-20120705-21jy2.html|work=Associated France Presse (AFP), Bloomberg|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=9 July 2012|author=Hiroshi Hiyama|date=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The report also urged the government to set clear disclosure rules about its relationship with nuclear operators.&lt;ref name="GlobeMail20120705" /&gt; Suggesting that the mind-set that supported the negligence at Fukushima "can be found across Japan," Kurokawa also urged citizens to "reflect on our responsibility as individuals in a democratic society."&lt;ref name="CNN20120705" /&gt;

The BBC summarised the recommendations of the NAICC as followed:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fukushima report: Key points in nuclear disaster report|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18718486|work=National Diet of Japan Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission (NAIIC)|publisher=BBC News Asia|accessdate=9 July 2012|date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* '''Permanent committee in [[Diet of Japan|National Diet]]''' to oversee the regulators, with regular investigations and hearings
* '''Reform of the crisis management system''', making boundaries between responsibilities of local and national governments and the operators clear, and establishing clear chain of command in emergency situations
* Establishment of '''system to deal with long-term public health effects''', including monitoring and decontaminating radiation-affected areas
* Dramatic '''corporate reform of Tepco''' and new relationships established among the electric power companies built on safety issues, mutual supervision and transparency

The {{nihongo|'''Rokkasho Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing Facility'''|六ヶ所村核燃料再処理施設|Rokkasho Kakunenryō Saishori Shisetsu}} is a [[nuclear reprocessing]] plant with an annual capacity of 800 tons of [[uranium]] or 8 tons of [[plutonium]].&lt;ref name=iaea10/&gt; It is owned by [[Japan Nuclear Fuel Limited]] (JNFL) and is part of the Rokkasho complex located in the village of [[Rokkasho, Aomori|Rokkasho]] in northeast [[Aomori Prefecture]], on the Pacific coast of the northernmost part of Japan's main island of [[Honshu]].

==History==
[[File:Rokkasho 2.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant]]
Construction of the plant began in 1993, and was originally expected to be completed in 1997, but the completion date has been postponed 23 times by 2017.&lt;ref name=wnn-20171228/&gt;&lt;ref name=nei-20171229&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsjapan-closes-ohi-12-and-monju-6014448 |title=Japan closes Ohi 1&amp;2 and Monju |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=29 December 2017 |accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction and testing of the facility were complete in 2013 according to JNFL, and the site was intended to begin operating in October 2013; however this was delayed by new safety regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324582004578456943867189804 Japan's Nuclear Plan Unsettles U.S.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jnfl.co.jp/english/topics/131219-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013 JNFL announced the plant would be ready for operation in October 2014.&lt;ref name=jt-20131220&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/12/20/national/work-on-rokkasho-fuel-reprocessing-plant-to-completed-by-october/ |title=Work on Rokkasho fuel reprocessing plant to be 'completed' by October |newspaper=The Japan Times |date=20 December 2013 |accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015, the start of the reprocessing plant was postponed again, this time to as late as September 2018.&lt;ref name=jt-20151117&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/11/17/national/fuel-reprocessing-plant-northern-japan-delayed-2018/ |title=Fuel reprocessing plant in northern Japan delayed again, to 2018 |last=Yamaguchi |first=Mari |publisher=The Japan Times |agency=Associated Press |date=17 November 2015 |accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, the completion date was put back a further three years, to 2021, to allow for further safety measures at the reprocessing plant and the [[MOX fuel]] fabrication plant to meet [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|post-Fukushima]] safety standards.&lt;ref name=wnn-20171228&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/WR-Further-delay-to-completion-of-Rokkasho-facilities-2812174.html |title=Further delay to completion of Rokkasho facilities |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=28 December 2017 |accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The delays have caused many parts of the plant to deteriorate, and the closure of the unsuccessful [[fast breeder reactor]] at [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant|Monju]] in 2016 reduces the need for the policy of nuclear fuel reprocessing.&lt;ref name=nei-20171229/&gt; In August 2018 more corroded pipes were found.&lt;ref name=nei-20180904&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsmore-problems-for-japans-rokkasho-reprocessing-plant-6732845 |title=More problems for Japan's Rokkasho reprocessing plant |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=4 September 2018 |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the [[Japanese Atomic Energy Commission]] updated plutonium guidelines to try to reduce plutonium stockpiles, stipulating that Rokkasho should only produce the amount of plutonium required for [[mixed oxide fuel]] for Japan's nuclear plants.&lt;ref name=nei-20180802&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsjapan-revises-plutonium-guidelines-6284647 |title=Japan revises plutonium guidelines |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=2 August 2018 |accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt-20180922&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/22/world/asia/japan-nuclear-weapon-recycle.html |title=Japan Has Enough Nuclear Material to Build an Arsenal.

== Description ==
The Rokkasho plant is the successor to a smaller reprocessing plant located in [[Tōkai, Ibaraki]] in central Japan, which ceased operation in 2007.

The Rokkasho facilities complex includes:
*A high level [[nuclear waste]] monitoring facility
*A [[MOX fuel]] fabrication plant
*A [[uranium enrichment]] plant&lt;ref name=CNIC-2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnic.jp/english/newsletter/nit140/nit140articles/uranenrich.html |title=Uranium Enrichment Plant Turns into a Big Waste Dump |publisher=CNIC |date=January 2011 |id=NIT 140 |accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=enformable-20111229&gt;{{cite news |url=http://enformable.com/2011/12/japan-upgrades-rokkasho-uranium-enrichment-facility-efficiency-400-to-500-percent/ |title=Japan upgrades Rokkasho Uranium Enrichment Facility efficiency 400 to 500 percent |newspaper=Enformable Nuclear News |date=29 December 2011 |accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A low level radioactive waste landfill
In 2010, the Rokkasho complex consisted of 38 buildings on an area of 3,800,000 m².&lt;ref name=iaea10&gt;{{cite web|last=Heinonen|first=Olli J.|title=Safeguards in action: IAEA at Rokkasho,  Japan|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/jrc/downloads/jrc_20100615_safeguards_heinonen.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2011|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vitrification]] tests completed in November 2007.  This consists of pouring high level dry waste residue along with molten glass into steel canisters.&lt;ref&gt;World Nuclear News (WNN). [http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/wasteRecycling/Vitrification_line_tested_for_Japanese_waste_061107.shtml Vitrification line tested for Japanese waste]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, over a third of Japan's 10 metric tons of domestically held [[plutonium]] is stored at Rokkasho.&lt;ref name=nyt-20180922/&gt;

==Economic aspects==
Since 1993 there has been US$20 billion invested in the project, nearly triple the original cost estimate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizen.org/documents/AileenMiokoSmithPresentation.pdf The Failures of Japan's Nuclear Fuel Cycle Program - 1956–2007]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 estimate put the cost at US$27.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, [https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0425/technology-rokkasho-japan-electric-nuclear-disaster.html Japan's Other Nuclear Disaster], 4/6/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests==

In May 2006, an international awareness campaign about the dangers of the Rokkasho reprocessing plant, [[Stop Rokkasho]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://stop-rokkasho.org/ Stop Rokkasho]&lt;/ref&gt; was launched by musician [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]]. [[Greenpeace]] has opposed the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant under a campaign called "Wings of Peace – No more Hiroshima Nagasaki",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.or.jp/campaign/nuclear/hiroshima/slide/index_en_html Wings of Peace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722121200/http://www.greenpeace.or.jp/campaign/nuclear/hiroshima/slide/index_en_html |date=22 July 2011 }} – No more Hiroshima Nagasaki&lt;/ref&gt; since 2002 and has launched a cyberaction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.or.jp/cyberaction/npt/index_en_html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030122702/http://www.greenpeace.or.jp/cyberaction/npt/index_en_html |archivedate=30 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to stop the project. [[Consumers Union of Japan]] together with 596 organisations and groups participated in a parade on 27 January 2008 in central Tokyo against the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nishoren.org/en/?p=35 Rokkasho: Nobody talks, Nothing changes « Consumers Union of Japan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Over 810,000 signatures were collected and handed in to the government on 28 January 2008. Representatives of the protesters, which include fishery associations, consumer cooperatives and surfer groups, handed the petition to the Cabinet Office and the [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]].

Seven consumer organisations have joined in this effort: [[Consumers Union of Japan]], Seikatsu Club Consumer's Co-operative Union, Daichi-o-Mamoru Kai, Green Consumer's Co-operative Union, Consumer's Co-operative Union "Kirari", Consumer's Co-operative Miyagi and Pal-system Co-operative Union.

'Experts including [[Frank von Hippel]], a [[Princeton University]] theoretical physicist, have urged Japan to stop spent fuel reprocessing.', reported ''[[The Japan Times]].''&lt;ref name=jt-20151117/&gt; The fundamental objection to reprocessing—the separation of plutonium from spent power reactor fuel—is that the plutonium is a nuclear explosive. Despite nuclear industry claims to the contrary, it usable for powerful nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Japan Times, May 31, 2017 article, one of whose authors is a weapon designer.&lt;/ref&gt; A plant like Rokkasho can separate several tons of plutonium per year. a nuclear weapon requires only several kilograms.

==2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami==
In June 2008, several scientists stated that the Rokkasho plant is sited directly above an active geological [[fault line]] that could produce a magnitude 8 earthquake. But Japan Nuclear Fuel Limited stated that there was no reason to fear an earthquake of more than magnitude 6.5 at the site, and that the plant could withstand a 6.9 quake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080604/full/453704a.html Japanese nuclear plant in quake risk] Nature.com, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://upiasiaonline.com/Security/2008/06/12/japans_nuclear_facilities_face_quake_risk/3945/ Japan's nuclear facilities face quake risk]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake]] (magnitude 9.1) in March 2011, the plant ran on emergency power provided by backup diesel generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Biello|first=David|title=How to Cool a Nuclear Reactor|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-to-cool-a-nuclear-reactor|work=Scientific American online|date=11 March 2011|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergency generators were not intended for long-term use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schneider|first=Mycle|title=Nuklearanlagen droht nach Erdbeben Überhitzung (German language)|url=http://www.focus.de/panorama/welt/tsunami-in-japan/tsunami-japan-nuklearanlagen-droht-nach-erdbeben-ueberhitzung_aid_607714.html|work=Focus online|date=11 March 2011|accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly there are about 3,000 tons of highly radioactive used [[nuclear fuel]] stored in Rokkasho at the current time. Japanese radio reported on 13 March that 600 liters of water leaked at the Rokkasho spent fuel pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Aileen|title=Breaking News—Japan Nuclear Power Plant Accidents and Earthquake|url=http://www.greenaction-japan.org/modules/wordpress1/index.php?p=2|work=Green Action Blog|date=13 March 2011|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', grid power was restored on 14 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/world/asia/18spent.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=2&amp;src=twrhp |title=Greater Danger Lies in Spent Fuel Than in Reactors |first=KEITH  |last=BRADSHER |first2=HIROKO | last2=TABUCHI |work=The New York Times |date=17 March 2011  |issn=0362-4331 |quote=Grid power was restored on Monday, the company said.  |accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 7 April aftershock caused the loss of grid power again until the next day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/2011/fukushima070411.html Fukushima Nuclear Accident Update Log], [[IAEA]], 7 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/2011/fukushima070411.html Fukushima Nuclear Accident Update Log], [[IAEA]], 8 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Sayonara Nuclear Power Plants'''|さようなら原発1000万人アクション|Sayōnara Genpatsu Issenmannin Akushon|lead=yes}} is an [[anti-nuclear]] organization and campaign in Japan.&lt;ref name="SayonaraNukes"&gt;[http://sayonara-nukes.org/ Sayonara-nukes.org]. Accessed: December 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Translated, its full name means "Citizens' Commission for the Ten Million People's Petition to Say Goodbye to Nuclear Power Plants", and as the name would suggest, its aim is to gather 10 million signatures protesting against nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name="Ogawa2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ogawa|first=Akihiro|chapter=Civil society: past, present, and future|editor1-last=Kingston|editor1-first=Jeff|title=Critical Issues in Contemporary Japan|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, New York|isbn=978-0-415-85745-1|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2013, the campaign had collected 8.3 million signatures.&lt;ref name="SayonaraNukes" /&gt;

== Aims ==

The group would like to see Japan's energy policy shifted away from [[nuclear power]] and towards [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref name="Ogawa2014" /&gt; The group's petition says, "What has become clear from the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] and later developments is this hard fact: there is no nuclear energy that is safe. In other words, nuclear technology and humanity cannot coexist."&lt;ref name=mdn12&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120208p2a00m0na011000c.html |title=Nobel Prize winner Oe stresses Japan's ethical responsibility for ending nuclear program |author=Shiro Yoneyama |date=February 8, 2012 |work=Mainichi Daily News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208190054/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120208p2a00m0na011000c.html |archivedate=February 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

As well as collecting signatures, the organization has held several anti-nuclear rallies. It held a rally of 60,000 people in [[Meiji Park]] (near [[Meiji Shrine]]), Tokyo, on September 17, 2011, and a rally in [[Koriyama]], Fukushima, on March 11, 2012, the first anniversary of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. On July 16, 2012, it held a rally in [[Yoyogi Park]], Tokyo, which drew 170,000 people.&lt;ref name="Ogawa2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name=mdn12/&gt; It has been suggested that these [[anti-nuclear protests]] and related activities may indicate new levels of political activism from urban workers and young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/22213/api103.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Post-Crisis Nuclear Policy|author=Daniel Aldrich |date=January 2012 |work=Asia Pacific Issues |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==

The group counts well-known celebrities in its ranks. Among the founding members are writer [[Kenzaburō Ōe]], historian [[Shunsuke Tsurumi]], and authors Hisae Sawachi, Katsuto Uchihashi and Keiko Ochiai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/06/kenzaburo-oe-nobel-winner-japan-nuclear_n_950085.html |title=Kenzaburo Oe, Nobel Winner Urges Japan To Abandon Nuclear Power |author=Mari Yamaguchi |date= September 2011 |work= Huffington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ogawa2014" /&gt; According to the group, its supporters also include [[Minamisoma]] Mayor Katsunobu Sakurai and [[Tokai Village]] Mayor Tatsuya Murakami, as well as film director [[Yoji Yamada]] and actress [[Sayuri Yoshinaga]].&lt;ref name=mdn12/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Masao Yoshida'''|吉田 昌郎|Yoshida Masao|extra=17 February 1955 – 9 July 2013}} was born in [[Osaka, Japan]] and was a General Manager in the Nuclear Asset Management Department of the [[Tokyo Electric Power Co.]], Inc. (TEPCO), [[Japan]]. He was the plant manager during the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], where he played a critical role by disobeying corporate headquarters orders to stop using seawater to cool the reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/13/world/asia/13japan.html?hp=&amp;pagewanted=print | title=In Nuclear Crisis, Crippling Mistrust |date=12 June 2011 |publisher=''New York Times''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to nuclear physicist (and co-founder of [[String field theory]]), Dr. [[Michio Kaku]], the decision to use seawater arguably prevented a much greater disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2011/06/01/physicist-michio-kaku-we-came-close-to-losing-northern-japan |title=Physicist Michio Kaku: We came close to losing northern Japan |date=1 June 2011 | publisher=CNN.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the last ditch effort to use seawater to cool the reactor, a much greater catastrophe that could have contaminated much of northern Japan may have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2011/06/01/physicist-michio-kaku-we-came-close-to-losing-northern-japan |title=Physicist Michio Kaku: We came close to losing northern Japan |date=1 June 2011 | publisher=CNN.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yoshida managed to gain the trust of Prime Minister [[Naoto Kan]], whom he met the day after the tsunami on a plant tour. They had both attended the [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]].

On 12 March 2011, about 28 hours after the tsunami struck, Yoshida and other TEPCO executives had ordered workers to start injecting seawater into Reactor No. 1 to keep the reactor from overheating and going into meltdown. But 21 minutes later, they ordered Yoshida to suspend the operation. Yoshida chose to ignore the order and ordered the plant workers to continue. At 20:05 JST that night, the Japanese government again ordered [[seawater]] to be injected into Unit 1.&lt;ref name=nisa313&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nisa.meti.go.jp/english/files/en20110313-3.pdf |title=Seismic Damage Information(the 19th Release) |date=13 March 2011 |publisher=[[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency]] |accessdate=12 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6E0qt3Eii?url=http://www.nisa.meti.go.jp/english/files/en20110313-3.pdf |archivedate=28 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The week of 7 June 2011, TEPCO gave Yoshida a verbal reprimand for defying the order and not reporting it earlier.

Yoshida was diagnosed with [[esophageal cancer]], which was determined by TEPCO to be unrelated to the nuclear accident, due to the rapidness of its onset.  He retired as plant manager in early December 2012.&lt;ref name=afp&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iX10KfPyCTZukARxlGJOegZLp8kg?docId=CNG.33ba93cd99323b241fb70a8bcd7637cf.5f1| title=Ex-chief of Japan nuclear plant has cancer|date=9 December 2011|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|work=Google News| accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tabuchi&gt;{{cite news|last=Tabuchi|first=Hiroko|title=Videos Shed Light on Chaos at Fukushima as a Nuclear Crisis Unfolded|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/10/world/asia/fukushima-videos-shed-light-on-chaos-in-nuclear-crisis.html|accessdate=12 August 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;According to the recent book 「死の淵を見た男」(門田隆将、PHP研究所, Dec. 4th, 2012　{{ISBN|978-4-569-80835-2}})&lt;/ref&gt; He  underwent an operation for the cancer and later suffered a non-fatal [[stroke]].

Yoshida died on 9 July 2013. He was 58 and is survived by his wife, Yoko, and three sons. "If Yoshida wasn’t there, the disaster could have been much worse”, said Reiko Hachisuka,  head of a business group in Okuma town. Former Prime Minister [[Naoto Kan]] [[tweeted]] a tribute, “I bow in respect for his leadership and decision-making".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Masao Yoshida, Nuclear Engineer and Chief at Fukushima Plant, Dies at 58|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/world/asia/masao-yoshida-nuclear-engineer-and-chief-at-fukushima-plant-dies-at-58.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;_r=0|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''international reaction to the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster''' has been diverse and widespread. Many inter-governmental agencies responded to the Japanese [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], often on an ad hoc basis. Responders included [[International Atomic Energy Agency]],  [[World Meteorological Organization]] and the Preparatory Commission for the [[Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization]], which has radiation detection equipment deployed around the world.&lt;ref name="14 March 2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://navyhandbook.org/190/uss-ronald-reagan-exposed-to-radiation/ |title=USS Ronald Reagan Exposed to Radiation |publisher=Navy Handbook |date=14 March 2011 |accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said the Japanese nuclear disaster "caused deep public anxiety throughout the world and damaged confidence in nuclear power".&lt;ref name="upi.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Resources/2011/09/23/IAEA-sees-slow-nuclear-growth-post-Japan/UPI-87041316777856/ |title=IAEA sees slow nuclear growth post Japan |date=23 September 2011 |work=UPI }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries have advised their nationals to leave Tokyo, citing the risk associated with the nuclear plants' ongoing accident. Nonetheless, estimates of radioactivity leakage into the [[Pacific Ocean]] remain modest with ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' reporting the leakage of approximately 0.3 Tbq per month of both &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs and &lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs.&lt;ref name="Leakage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com.au/news/energy/2013/08/130807-fukushima-radioactive-water-leak/ |title=Fukushima's Radioactive Water Leak: What You Should Know |date=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 0.3 TBq is equal to &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of the natural radiation in one km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of seawater and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;50000000000&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of the total natural radioactivity in the oceans.&lt;ref name="Natural Radioactivity"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physics.isu.edu/radinf/natural.htm |title=Radioactivity in Nature }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Fukushima I accidents, ''[[The Economist]]'' reported that the [[International Energy Agency]] halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035.&lt;ref name=economist-20110428&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18621367?story_id=18621367 |title=Gauging the pressure |date=28 April 2011 |work=The Economist }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany accelerated plans to close all of its old [[nuclear power]] reactors and to phase the rest out entirely by 2022. The policy is controversial &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/wind-power-investments-in-germany-proving-riskier-than-thought-a-946367.html |title=Wind Power Investments in Germany Proving Riskier than Thought - SPIEGEL ONLINE |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=2014-01-30 |accessdate=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to electricity twice the price of that in neighbouring [[France]]. [[Der Spiegel]] reported that German Economy and Energy Minister [[Sigmar Gabriel]] admitted that "exiting nuclear and coal-fired power generation at the same time would not be possible".&lt;ref name="Sigmar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/12/uk-germany-energy-idUKKCN0I10LW20141012 |title=Germany says can't exit coal-fired energy at same time as nuclear |date=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy there was a national referendum, in which 94 percent voted against the governments plan to build new [[nuclear power plant]]s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Elsewhere in the world, nuclear power continues to be discussed in Malaysia,&lt;ref name="Nuklear Malaysia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclearmalaysia.gov.my/|title=Nuklear malaysia |date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plans are well-advanced in the [[United Arab Emirates]],&lt;ref name="Nuclear Power in the United Arab Emirates"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries-T-Z/United-Arab-Emirates/|title=Nuclear Power in the United Arab Emirates |date=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nuclear Power Plant in Abu Dhabi"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.venturesonsite.com/projects/united-arab-emirates-/power-water/597-nuclear-power-plant-in-abu-dhabi--main-file|title=Nuclear Abu Dhabi|date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan,&lt;ref name="Nuclear Power in Jordan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries-G-N/Jordan/|title=Nuclear Power in Jordan |date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="Nuclear Power in Bangladesh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries-A-F/Bangladesh/|title=Nuclear Power in Bangladesh|date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; China briefly paused its nuclear development program, but has since restarted it. China plans to treble its nuclear capacity to at least 58 GWe by 2020, then some 150 GWe by 2030, and much more by 2050.&lt;ref name="Nuclear Power in China"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries-A-F/China--Nuclear-Power/|title=Nuclear Power in China|date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear industry==
According to [[Areva]]'s Southeast Asia and Oceania director, Selena Ng, Japan's [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] is "a huge wake-up call for a nuclear industry that hasn't always been sufficiently transparent about safety issues". She said "There was a sort of complacency before Fukushima and I don't think we can afford to have that complacency now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2011/04/20/areva-says-fukushima-huge-wake-nuclear-industry/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110701150830/http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2011/04/20/areva-says-fukushima-huge-wake-nuclear-industry/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 July 2011 |title=Areva Says Fukushima A Huge Wake-Up Call For Nuclear Industry |author=David Fickling |date=20 April 2011 |work=Fox Business }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, German engineering giant [[Siemens]] announced it will withdraw entirely from the nuclear industry, as a response to the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] in Japan, and said that it would no longer build nuclear power plants anywhere in the world. The company's chairman, Peter Löscher, said that "Siemens was ending plans to cooperate with Rosatom, the Russian state-controlled nuclear power company, in the construction of dozens of nuclear plants throughout Russia over the coming two decades".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/business/energy-environment/the-year-of-peril-and-promise-in-energy-production.html?src=un&amp;feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fjson8.nytimes.com%2Fpages%2Fbusiness%2Fglobal%2Findex.jsonp  |title=The Year of Peril and Promise in Energy Production |author=John Broder |date=10 October 2011   |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14963575 |title=Siemens to quit nuclear industry |date=18 September 2011  |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Siemens is to boost its work in the [[renewable energy]] sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,787020,00.html  |title=Siemens to Exit Nuclear Energy Business |date=19 September 2011 |work=Der Spiegel  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory agencies==
Many inter-governmental agencies are responding, often on an ad hoc basis. Responders include [[International Atomic Energy Agency]],  [[World Meteorological Organization]] and the Preparatory Commission for the [[Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization]], which has radiation detection equipment deployed around the world.&lt;ref name="14 March 2011"/&gt;

Some scientists say that the [[2011 Japanese nuclear accidents]] have revealed that the nuclear industry lacks sufficient oversight, leading to renewed calls to redefine the mandate of the IAEA so that it can better police nuclear power plants worldwide.&lt;ref name=csmon/&gt; There are several problems with the IAEA says Najmedin Meshkati of University of Southern California:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It recommends safety standards, but member states are not required to comply; it promotes nuclear energy, but it also monitors nuclear use; it is the sole global organization overseeing the nuclear energy industry, yet it is also weighed down by checking compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).&lt;ref name=csmon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2011/0317/Japan-nuclear-crisis-sparks-calls-for-IAEA-reform |title=Japan nuclear crisis sparks calls for IAEA reform |author=Stephen Kurczy  |date=17 March 2011 |work=CSMonitor.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The journal ''Nature'' has reported that the IAEA response to the Fukushima nuclear crisis in Japan was "sluggish and sometimes confusing", drawing calls for the agency to "take a more proactive role in nuclear safety". But nuclear experts say that the agency's complicated mandate and the constraints imposed by its member states mean that reforms will not happen quickly or easily, although its INES "emergency scale is very likely to be revisited" given the confusing way in which it was used in Japan.&lt;ref name=iaea2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110426/full/472397a.html |title=Nuclear agency faces reform calls |author=Geoff Brumfiel |date=26 April 2011 |work=Nature }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian nuclear opponent Iouli Andreev was critical of the response to Fukushima, and says that the IAEA did not learn from the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]]. He has accused the IAEA and corporations of "wilfully ignoring lessons from the world's worst nuclear accident 25 years ago to protect the industry's expansion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/15/us-chernobyl-clean-up-expert-slams-japan-idUSTRE72E7AL20110315 |title=Chernobyl clean-up expert slams Japan, IAEA |author=Michael Shields |date=15 March 2011  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IAEA's role "as an advocate for nuclear power has made it a target for protests".&lt;ref name=iaea2011/&gt;

One of the IAEA statutory functions is to establish safety standards to protect the health, life and property in the use of nuclear power. When reports of the damaged nuclear power plants at Fukushima emerged, many countries looked immediately to the IAEA for more information. But its initial reports provided scant and at times contradictory information from Japanese sources and it took a week for the IAEA to dispatch a team to Japan to gather more facts on the ground.&lt;ref name=olli/&gt; While the IAEA has stated that it was hampered by lack of official information from Japan, this "has nonetheless prompted analysts to question the efficacy of the Agency". Olli Heinonen has said that "Fukushima should be a wake-up call to re-evaluate and strengthen the role of the IAEA in boosting nuclear safety, including its response mechanism".&lt;ref name=olli&gt;{{cite web |url=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/power/2011/03/22/the-iaea-and-the-nuclear-crisis-at-fukushima/ |title=The IAEA and the Nuclear Crisis at Fukushima  |author=Olli Heinonen  |date=22 March 2011  |work=Power &amp; Policy |publisher=Belfer Center }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 March 2011, at a special briefing on the Fukshima nuclear accidents held for IAEA Member States, IAEA Director General [[Yukiya Amano]] announced that a high-level ''IAEA Conference on Nuclear Safety'' should take place in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/emergencyresponse.html |title=High Level Conference Called to Strengthen Nuclear Safety and Emergency Response |date=28 March 2011 |work=Staff Report |publisher=IAEA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], Japan "underestimated the danger of tsunamis and failed to prepare adequate backup systems at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant".  This repeated a widely held criticism in Japan that "collusive ties between regulators and industry led to weak oversight and a failure to ensure adequate safety levels at the plant".&lt;ref name=nyt2011/&gt; The IAEA also said that the Fukushima disaster exposed the lack of adequate backup systems at the plant. Once power was completely lost, critical functions like the cooling system shut down. Three of the reactors "quickly overheated, causing meltdowns that eventually led to explosions, which hurled large amounts of radioactive material into the air".&lt;ref name=nyt2011&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/world/asia/02japan.html?_r=1&amp;ref=world |title=Report Finds Japan Underestimated Tsunami Danger |author=Martin Fackler |date=1 June 2011 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March, Denis Flory, IAEA deputy director general and head of the agency's nuclear safety and security department, said readings from soil samples collected in Iitate indicate that one of the IAEA operational criteria for evacuation is exceeded there. On 31 March, In response to the IAEA, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said Thursday the government may implement measures, if necessary, such as urging people living in the area to evacuate, if it is found that the contaminated soil will have a long-term effect on human health. Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, told a press conference in the afternoon that the agency's rough estimates have shown there is no need for people in Iitate to evacuate immediately under criteria set by the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://e.nikkei.com/e/fr/tnks/Nni20110331D3ZJF606.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese government declined recommendation of IAEA.

In April 2011, representatives from dozens of countries met in Austria to scrutinize safety at each other's power plants with the aim of avoiding accidents such as the Japanese nuclear crisis. The meeting was hosted by the International Atomic Energy Agency and focused on the [[Convention on Nuclear Safety]] that came into being in the wake of the [[Three Mile Island accident]] and [[Chernobyl disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gGK6ampQ-KsnqlmthlJAU7jNYezQ?docId=6456241  |title=UN nuclear safety meeting convenes in Vienna amid concerns over Japanese reactor crisis |author=Veronika Oleksyn |date=4 April 2011  |work=The Canadian Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 April 2011, the IAEA reported that the nuclear accident at Fukushima I is now rated as a Level 7 "major accident" on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale|INES]] scale. Level 7 is the most serious level on INES and is used to describe an event consisting of "a major release of radioactive material with widespread health and environmental effects requiring implementation of planned and extended countermeasures."&lt;ref name=Robertm&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/12/a-look-at-the-nuclear-accident-scale/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss |title=A Look at the Nuclear Accident Scale |author=Robert Mackey |date=12 April 2011  |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the previous month, some scientists in the United States and the head of France's Nuclear Safety Authority argued that the accident was, at that time, already worse than the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]] in Pennsylvania, which was rated a 5.&lt;ref name=Robertm/&gt;

Following the Fukushima I accidents, the [[International Energy Agency]] halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035.&lt;ref name="economist-20110428"/&gt;

In September 2011, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said the Japanese nuclear disaster "caused deep public anxiety throughout the world and damaged confidence in nuclear power".&lt;ref name="upi.com"/&gt;

==Non-government organizations==
Linda Gunter of [[Beyond Nuclear]] spoke to the ''[[World Socialist Web Site]]'' on 19 March 2011.  Gunter stated that the disaster could not be called an accident because it was the outcome of a "gamble [that] has been going on since the dawn of the nuclear age".&lt;ref name="Gunter Interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=An interview with Linda Gunter of Beyond Nuclear: "This was a preventable catastrophe"|url=http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2011/03/gunt-m19.html|work=World Socialist Web Site|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also voiced concern over Fukushima-style reactors operating in the United States.  Beyond Nuclear began a campaign to shut these reactors down on 13 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Support the Nuclear Petition to NRC to suspend the operation of 23 Fukushima-style reactors in the United States|url=http://www.beyondnuclear.org/home/2011/6/11/support-the-beyond-nuclear-petition-to-nrc-to-suspend-operat.html|work=Beyond Nuclear|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Future Council]] issued a "Statement on the Japanese Nuclear Disaster" on 29 March 2011, supported by many [[Right Livelihood Award]] Laureates. It said that the disaster in Japan has demonstrated the limits of human capability to keep dangerous technologies free from accidents with catastrophic results:&lt;ref name=worldf/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The conclusion we draw from the nuclear power plant accident in Japan is that the human community, acting for itself and as trustees for future generations, must exercise a far higher level of care globally in dealing with technologies capable of causing mass annihilation, and should phase out, abolish and replace such technologies with alternatives that do not threaten present and future generations. This applies to nuclear weapons as well as to nuclear power reactors.&lt;ref name=worldf&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldfuturecouncil.org/jointstatement.html |title=Statement on the Japanese Nuclear Disaster |date=29 March 2011  |publisher=World Future Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Citing the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], environmental activists at a U.N. meeting in April 2011 "urged bolder steps to tap [[renewable energy]] so the world doesn't have to choose between the dangers of nuclear power and the ravages of climate change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gA36EtO2y0Cuvw3w1X8O2TMPRYtw?docId=695dc2e92bf04303a5322dbcd94e36a9 |title=Activists call for renewable energy at UN meeting  |date=4 April 2011  |agency=Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some shipping lines restricted their ships from calling on the [[Tokyo Bay]] ports of [[Port of Tokyo|Tokyo]] and [[Port of Yokohama|Yokohama]] over radiation concerns.  Vessels risk facing extra delays for checks at subsequent destinations if they pick up even trace contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/business/global/26shipping.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Global Supply Lines at Risk as Shipping Lines Shun Japan |author=Keith Bradsher |date=25 March 2011 |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greenpeace===
Greenpeace sent radiology experts to the villages of [[Iitate, Fukushima|Iitate]] and Tsushima in the Fukushima Prefecture.  They found levels up to 100&amp;nbsp;μSv/h in the village of Iitate, and based on that, recommended that the government widen the 20&amp;nbsp;km no-go zone, which Iitate lies outside of, to at least 30&amp;nbsp;km.  An official of the NSA said that high radioactivity levels detected by the NGO could not be considered reliable, although some members of Greenpeace stressed that their numbers corresponded in other areas.&lt;ref name=JTO&gt;{{cite news|last=Hongo|first=Jun|title=NGO finds high levels in safe area|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110331a2.html|accessdate=11 April 2011|newspaper=The Japan Times Online|date=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The New York Times called the reporting by Greenpeace (with a well-known anti-nuclear position) a "guarded endorsement to the radiation data published by the Japanese government", due to the general correspondence between the numbers.  Members of Greenpeace stressed that there has been distrust of the official data, and that their contention was not the radiation levels, but the action that was taken.&lt;ref name=NTY&gt;{{cite news|last=Jolly|first=David|title=Japanese Operator Says It Will Scrap Four Reactors at Plant|url=http://stretchingminds.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/japanese-operator-says-it-will-scrap-four-reactors-at-plant/|accessdate=30 March 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial markets==
As a result of the accidents, [[stock price]]s of many energy companies reliant on nuclear sources and listed on [[stock exchange]]s have dropped, while renewable energy companies have increased dramatically in value. In Germany, demand for renewable energy has increased among private consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/oekostrom-wird-zum-grossen-renner/3956318.html|title=Ökostrom wird zum großen Renner|language=German|date=16 March 2011|accessdate=18 March 2011|publisher=[[Handelsblatt]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/news-032011/16/iptc-bdt-20110316-592-29293128xml|work=[[Die Zeit]]|title=Immer mehr Verbraucher wollen Ökostrom|language=German|date=16 March 2011|accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funds that invested in companies tied to [[renewable energy]], [[clean technology]], the oil industry and other natural resources rose 13.7% in the first three months of 2011, "benefiting from turmoil in the oil-rich Middle East and the [[anti-nuclear]] sentiment after the accident in Japan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/funds/2011-04-05-natural-resources-funds.htm |title=Chaos in energy sector drives gains in clean energy |author=Adam Shell |date=6 April 2011 |work=USA TODAY }}&lt;/ref&gt;

International experts have said that a workforce in the hundreds or even thousands would take years or decades to clean up the area.&lt;ref name=calamity/&gt; John Price, a former member of the Safety Policy Unit at the UK's National Nuclear Corporation, has said that it "might be 100 years before melting fuel rods can be safely removed from Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/04/01/3179487.htm |title=Crews 'facing 100-year battle' at Fukushima |author=David Mark, Mark Willacy |date=1 April 2011 |work=ABC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Morse, a professor of nuclear engineering at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], has said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...there would be at least six months of emergency stabilisation, about two years of temporary remediation and up to 30 years of full-scale clean-up. Furthermore, the high levels of ground contamination at the site are raising concerns about the viability of individuals to work at the site in coming decades.&lt;ref name=calamity&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/containing-a-calamity-creates-another-nuclear-nightmare-20110408-1d7qn.html |title=Containing a calamity creates another nuclear nightmare |author=Julie Makinen, Ralph Vartabedian  |date=9 April 2011  |work=Sydney Morning Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests and politics by country==

===Taiwan===
In March 2011, around 2,000 anti-nuclear protesters demonstrated in Taiwan for an immediate halt to the construction of the island's fourth nuclear power plant. The protesters were also opposed to plans to extend the lifespan of three existing nuclear plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Asia/Story/A1Story20110320-269104.html |title=Over 2,000 rally against nuclear plants in Taiwan |date=20 March 2011  |agency=AFP }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amid Japan's ongoing nuclear crisis, nuclear energy is emerging as a contentious issue for [[Republic of China presidential election, 2012|next year's presidential election]] in Taiwan, as opposition leader [[Tsai Ing-wen]] declared her intention to abandon nuclear power by 2025 if elected. Taiwan is on the West Pacific Rim earthquake zone, like Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/MC29Ad02.html |title=Cold comfort for anti-nuclear Taiwanese |author=Jou Ying-cheng |date=29 March 2011 |work=Asia Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Hsu, a professor of applied economics at National Chung Hsing University in central Taiwan, said nuclear power plants in quake-prone areas need to be redesigned to make them more resistant, an investment that would reduce their original cost advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-12/taiwan-halts-plans-to-build-atomic-reactors-after-japan-crisis.html |title=Quake-Prone Taiwan Halts Nuclear Expansion as Japan Struggles at Fukushima |author=Yu-huay Sun  |date=13 April 2011   |work=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, 5,000 people joined an anti-nuclear protest in [[Taipei City]], which was characterized by a carnival-like atmosphere, with protesters holding yellow banners and clutching sunflowers.  This was part of a nationwide "No Nuke Action" protest, urging the government to stop construction of a Fourth Nuclear Plant and pursue a more [[sustainable energy]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2011/05/01/2003502115 |title=Anti-nuclear rally draws legions |author=Lee I-Chia |date=1 May 2011 |work=The Taipei Times  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eve of [[World Environment Day]] in June 2011, environmental groups demonstrated against Taiwan's nuclear power policy. The Taiwan Environmental Protection Union, together with 13 environmental groups and legislators, gathered in Taipei with banners that read: "I love Taiwan, not nuclear disasters".&lt;ref name=taipai2011/&gt; They protested against the nation's three operating nuclear power plants and the construction of a fourth plant. They also called for "all nuclear power plants to be thoroughly re-evaluated and shut down immediately if they fail to pass safety inspections". According to Wang To-far, economics professor at [[National Taipei University]], "if a level-seven nuclear crisis were to happen in Taiwan, it would destroy the nation".&lt;ref name=taipai2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2011/06/05/2003505021 |title=Conservationists protest against nuclear policies |author=Lee I-Chia |date=5 June 2011 |work=Tapai Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
What had been growing acceptance of nuclear power in the United States was eroded sharply following the [[2011 Japanese nuclear accidents]], with public support for building nuclear power plants in the U.S. dropping slightly lower than it was immediately after the [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979, according to a CBS News poll. Only 43 percent of those polled after the Fukushima nuclear emergency said they would approve building new power plants in the United States.&lt;ref name="Michael Cooper"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/us/23poll.html?_r=1 |title=Nuclear Power Loses Support in New Poll |author=Michael Cooper |date=22 March 2011 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activists who were involved in the U.S. anti-nuclear movement's emergence (such as [[Graham Nash]] and [[Paul Gunter]]), suggest that Japan's nuclear crisis may rekindle an interest in the movement in the United States. The aim, they say, is "not just to block the Obama administration's push for new nuclear construction, but to convince Americans that existing plants pose dangers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/19/science/earth/19antinuke.html?_r=1 |title=Japan Crisis Could Rekindle U.S. Antinuclear Movement |author=Leslie Kaufman |date=18 March 2011 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, 600 people gathered for a weekend protest outside the [[Vermont Yankee]] nuclear plant. The demonstration was held to show support for the thousands of Japanese people who are endangered by possible radiation from the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wcax.com/Global/story.asp?S=14288307 |title=Vermont Yankee: Countdown to closure |date=21 March 2011 |work=WCAX  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New England region has a long history of [[anti-nuclear]] activism and 75 people held a State House rally on 6 April 2011, to "protest the region's aging nuclear plants and the increasing stockpile of radioactive spent fuel rods at them".&lt;ref name=regainsvoice/&gt; The protest was held shortly before a State House hearing where legislators were scheduled to hear representatives of the region's three nuclear plants – Pilgrim in Plymouth, Vermont Yankee in Vernon, and Seabrook in New Hampshire—talk about the safety of their reactors in the light of the Japanese nuclear crisis. Vermont Yankee and Pilgrim have designs similar to the crippled Japanese nuclear plant.&lt;ref name=regainsvoice&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2011/04/anti-nuclear_se.html |title=Anti-nuclear sentiment regains its voice at State House rally|author=Martin Finucane  |date=6 April 2011  |work=Boston Globe  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nuclear disaster in Japan is likely to have major effects on US energy policy, according to billionaire investor [[Warren Buffett]]. Buffet said that the "United States was poised to move ahead with nuclear plans here, but the events in Japan derailed that".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/42178651/Japan_Disaster_To_Delay_US_Nuclear_Energy_Plans_Buffett |title=Japan Disaster To Delay US Nuclear Energy Plans: Buffett |author=Becky Quick |date=20 March 2011 |work=CNBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Rochelle Becker, executive director of the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility said that the United States should review its nuclear accident liability limits, in the light of the economic impacts of the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|Fukushima I nuclear disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/04/18/EDAV1J2TQ7.DTL |title=Who would pay if nuclear disaster happened here? |author=Rochelle Becker  |date=18 April 2011   |work=San Francisco Chronicle  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, as Japan completed "step 2" of its control roadmap at Fukushima, U.S. NRC chairman Jaczko visited the plant and said afterwards "that there was no longer enough energy in the reactors at the crippled Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Power Plant to produce an offsite release of radiation, but pointed out that a large cleanup task remained".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111221p2a00m0na007000c.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221193033/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111221p2a00m0na007000c.html |archivedate=21 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Germany
In March 2011, more than 200,000 people took part in anti-nuclear protests in four large German cities, on the eve of state elections. Organisers called it the biggest anti-nuclear demonstration the country has seen, with police estimating that 100,000 people turned out in Berlin alone. Hamburg, Munich and Cologne also saw big demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/03/26/germany-nuclear-idUKLDE72P0FG20110326 |title=Anti-nuclear Germans protest on eve of state vote |date=26 March 2011  |work=Reuters |first=Stephen |last=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New York Times'' reported that "most Germans have a deep-seated aversion to nuclear power, and the damage at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan has galvanized opposition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/28/world/europe/28germany.html?_r=1  |title=Merkel Loses Key German State on Nuclear Fears |author=Judy Dempsey |date=27 March 2011  |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Japan's nuclear disaster, there was an [[Baden-Württemberg state election, 2011|all-time best state election result]] for the [[anti-nuclear]] Green Party in Germany in the [[Baden-Württemberg]] election on 27 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/28/germany-election-greens-idUSLDE72Q0KS20110328 |title=RPT-Germany's Greens come of age after Japan disaster |author=Erik Kirschbaum  |date=28 March 2011  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Greens' rise in popularity, which began October 2010 in the polls, has also been attributed to the unanimous opposition to [[Stuttgart 21]].&lt;ref name="FT1"&gt;{{cite news|title=CDU wary after Stuttgart rail project approval|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1614de80-fcac-11df-bfdd-00144feab49a.html#axzz16zAkNhAv|work=Financial Times|date=29 November 2010|accessdate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDU-led government under Chancellor Angela Merkel made an aboutface in their nuclear energy policy. In 2010 the Government had just prolonged the retention period of nuclear power plants which were scheduled to be phased out in 2021 by the nuclear phase-out plan of 2000. In light of the Fukushima disaster, the Government changed its mind:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A physicist by training and a former environment minister, Merkel understood what Fukushima meant. Germany has 17 reactors, providing 23 percent of the electrical power in the country and making it the sixth largest nuclear electricity producer in the world. The eight oldest reactors were taken off the grid within days of 3/11 and will not return to operation. In record time, what once was the most pro-nuclear German government in decades prepared comprehensive legislation to phase out the remaining nine reactors by 2022 at the latest, starting in 2015. In June, parliament overwhelmingly passed the law (513 in favor, 79 against, 8 abstentions).&lt;ref name="Mycle Schneider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/fukushima-crisis-can-japan-be-the-forefront-of-authentic-paradigm-shift |title=Fukushima crisis: Can Japan be at the forefront of an authentic paradigm shift? |author=Mycle Schneider |date=9 September 2011 |work=[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106021131/http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/fukushima-crisis-can-japan-be-the-forefront-of-authentic-paradigm-shift |archivedate=6 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, there has been rapid growth in energy use and there are plans to build the world's largest nuclear plant in Jaitapur, but anti-nuclear protests have intensified following the Fukushima crisis.&lt;ref name="Alex Martin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nb20110528x1.html |title=G-8 differ in reactions to Fukushima |author=Alex Martin |date=28 May 2011 |work=The Japan Times  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 April one man was shot and killed by police and eight were injured after protests against the planned [[Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project]] turned violent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gc1zxEqG5c895I8zEM2vePR9LoeQ?docId%3DCNG.03f9550f39158525b47a166b6f5d4741.421 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419013521/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gc1zxEqG5c895I8zEM2vePR9LoeQ?docId=CNG.03f9550f39158525b47a166b6f5d4741.421 |archivedate=19 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although protests have been ongoing for some years, they have gained greater prominence and support since Fukushima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatespectator.com.au/commentary/view-jaitapur?cookie_check=1&amp;= |title=Nocookies &amp;#124; The Australian |publisher=Climatespectator.com.au |date= |accessdate=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/politics-add-danger-to-jaitapur-nuclear-plant-protests-99937 |title=Politics add danger to Jaitapur nuclear plant protests |publisher=Ndtv.com |date=2011-04-19 |accessdate=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Italy
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi announced in 2009 that Italy would go nuclear again after its four atomic power plants were shut down following a 1987 nationwide referendum. But in the wake of the Fukushima crisis, antinuclear rallies drawing thousands have erupted in Italy, and the Italian government has "decided on a one-year moratorium on its plans to revive nuclear power".&lt;ref name="Alex Martin"/&gt;

A further [[Italian referendums, 2011|Italian nuclear power referendum]] was held on 13 June 2011 and the No vote won 94,05 %, leading to cancellation of future nuclear power plants planned during the previous years, and due to the Italian nuclear power referendum turn out being over 50%+1 of the Italian population creates a legally binding cancellation of future plants.

;Spain
In March 2011, hundreds of people took part in protests held across Spain to demand the closure of the country's six nuclear power stations, after Japan's nuclear accidents. Demonstrators, many with signs that read "No nuclear power, neither here nor in Japan", gathered in small groups in more than 30 cities, including Madrid, Barcelona, Seville and Valencia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j-hX7fOLMkQOUJhgWSgQYsNztRtA?docId=CNG.af94279f2de063afb3fd0d2db3261792.1331 |title=Anti-nuclear demonstrations held across Spain  |date=17 March 2011  |agency=AFP }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, new-reactor construction has also suffered—not because of public opposition but because of economics and tougher, yet-to-be-determined, safety regulations. In 2007, U.S. utilities applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to build 28 nuclear-power plants before 2020; now, if more than three come online before the end of the decade, it will be a major accomplishment.&lt;ref name=nweek11/&gt;

France is, per capita, the world's most nuclear-powered state. Frequently heralded as a nuclear commercial model for the world, today it's locked in a national debate over a partial nuclear phaseout. President Nicolas Sarkozy is still backing nuclear power, but his Socialist opponent, François Hollande, now well ahead in the polls, has proposed cutting nuclear power's electricity contribution by more than a third by 2025.&lt;ref name=nweek11/&gt;

==Renewable energy==
[[Nancy Folbre]], an economics professor, has said that the biggest positive result of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster could be renewed public support for the [[Renewable energy commercialization|commercialization of renewable energy technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/28/renewing-support-for-renewables/ |title=Renewing Support for Renewables |author=Nancy Folbre |date=28 March 2011 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, London-based bank HSBC said: "With Three Mile Island and Fukushima as a backdrop, the US public may find it difficult to support major nuclear new build and we expect that no new plant extensions will be granted either. Thus we expect the clean energy standard under discussion in US legislative chambers will see a far greater emphasis on gas and [[renewable energy|renewables]] plus [[Efficient energy use|efficiency]]".&lt;ref name="HSBC 2011"&gt;HSBC (2011). Climate investment update: Japan's nuclear crisis and the case for clean energy. ''HSBC Global Research'', 18 March.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Deutsche Bank]] analysts concluded that "the global impact of the Fukushima accident is a fundamental shift in public perception with regard to how a nation prioritizes and values its populations health, safety, security, and natural environment when determining its current and future energy pathways". As a consequence, "[[renewable energy]] will be a clear long-term winner in most energy systems, a conclusion supported by many voter surveys conducted over the past few weeks. At the same time, we consider natural gas to be, at the very least, an important transition fuel, especially in those regions where it is considered secure".&lt;ref name="Deutsche Bank Group 2011"&gt;Deutsche Bank Group (2011). The 2011 inflection point for energymarkets: Health, safety, security and the environment. ''DB Climate Change Advisors'', 2 May.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, [[Mycle Schneider]] said that the Fukushima disaster can be understood as a unique chance "to get it right" on [[energy policy]]. "Germany – with its nuclear phase-out decision based on a highly successful renewable energy program – and Japan – having suffered a painful shock but possessing unique technical capacities and societal discipline – can be at the forefront of an authentic paradigm shift toward a truly sustainable, low-carbon and nuclear-free energy policy".&lt;ref name="Mycle Schneider"/&gt;

[[File:Tyvek house wrap.jpg|thumb|Tyvek house wrap]]
'''Tyvek''' ({{IPAc-en|t|ai|ˈ|v|ɛ|k}}) is a [[brand]] of [[flashspun]] [[high-density polyethylene]] [[fiber]]s, a [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] material; the name is a [[registered trademark]] of the [[DuPont]] company, well known for their production of chemicals and textiles. Tyvek is often used as [[housewrap]], a synthetic material used to protect buildings during construction. The material is difficult to tear but can easily be cut with [[scissor]]s or a knife. [[Water vapor]] can pass through Tyvek, but liquid water cannot. All of these properties make Tyvek useful in a variety of applications.

==History==
Tyvek is a [[Nonwoven fabric|nonwoven]] product consisting of spun bond [[olefin fiber]]. It was first discovered in 1955 by a researcher for the DuPont [[textile]] company, named Jim White. While working in an experimental lab, Jim noticed a type of white fluff coming out of a pipe in a DuPont experimental lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dupont.com/products-and-services/fabrics-fibers-nonwovens/protective-fabrics/brands/tyvek.html|title=Tyvek® brand - For Greater Good™|author=admin|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207232132/http://www2.dupont.com/Tyvek/en_US/products/about_pgs/history.html|archivedate=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; That fluff was a product known as [[polyethylene]], which DuPont requested a patent for within a year of the discovery. After technologies improved during the next few years, in 1959 DuPont discovered that when the fluff was spun at high speeds it produced a durable fabric that was able to be cut with a blade. While the product Tyvek was used since 1959, DuPont did not trademark the actual brand until 1965, making it available for  commercial purposes in April 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dupont.com/products-and-services/fabrics-fibers-nonwovens/protective-fabrics/brands/tyvek/tyvek-media-center.html|title=DuPont™ Tyvek® Marks 40 Years of Energy Efficiency and Protection|publisher=[[DuPont]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209122333/http://www2.dupont.com/Tyvek/en_US/news_events/article20070619.html|archivedate=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 1970, Tyvek had reached the mainstream construction industry on both a national and global scale, and is often used for the construction of houses due to its unique ability to keep out liquid, while allowing vapor through.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.dupont.com/Building_Innovations/en_CN/knowledgeCenter/kc_tyvekhistory.html|title=History of Weather Barrier|website=www2.dupont.com|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, DuPont released Tyvek packaging for sterile instruments that were to be used by surgeons and doctors in the medical field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dupont.com/content/dam/dupont/products-and-services/packaging-materials-and-solutions/medical-and-pharmaceutical-packaging-materials/documents/MPP_Introduction_to_DuPont_Tyvek.pdf|website=www.dupont.com|access-date=2018-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st century ===
In 2017, [[DuPont]] and [[Focus DIY]] entered an current agreement to sell Tyvek along with [[DuPont]]’s other products at [[Focus DIY]] stores. In 2017, the DuPont company merged with another chemical company, [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow Chemicals]] to form [[DowDuPont]]. The net worth of this newly merged company is over $150 billion as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.delawareonline.com/story/money/business/2018/08/02/dowdupont-dupont-earnings-delaware-breen/888844002/|title=DowDuPont announces earnings, but few new details about spin-off companies|work=delawareonline|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the DuPont company still makes Tyvek, it also produces products such as [[Kevlar]] and cellophane, among numerous other chemical products. Tyvek is currently manufactured at the Spruance plant in [[Richmond, Virginia]], and in [[Sandweiler]]-[[Contern]], [[Luxembourg]]. In 2018, DowDuPont announced that they would spend $400 million to increase the amount of Tyvek that could be produced in the Sandweiler-Contern factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nonwovens-industry.com/contents/view_breaking-news/2018-06-05/dupont-announces-400-million-tyvek-expansion/|title=DuPont Announces $400 Million Tyvek Expansion|website=Nonwovens Industry Magazine - News, Markets &amp; Analysis for the Nonwovens Industry|access-date=2018-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adhesion and bonding ===
DuPont recommends [[starch]], [[dextrin]], [[casein]], and [[Animal glue|animal-based]] [[adhesive]]s over most [[Adhesive#Synthetic|synthetic-based adhesives]], emphasizing the effectiveness of water-based and quick-drying glues as the best for bonding Tyvek both to itself and to a variety of substrates.  DuPont also claims that the following [[adhesive]]s are highly effective:

* Water-based synthetic lattices
* Ethylene/[[vinyl acetate]]
* Acrylic pressure-sensitive tape
* Solvent-based single-component [[polyurethane]]
* [[Hot glue]]

[[Heat sealing]] can be used to melt Tyvek and cause it to bond to itself, but this form of bonding tends to create puckers in the otherwise flat material. [[Dielectric]] bonding can be effective in some circumstances, as is [[ultrasonic welding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dupont.com/products-and-services/packaging-materials-solutions/industrial-packaging/articles/seaming-and-sealing.html|title=Seaming and Sealing with DuPont™ Tyvek®|last=|first=|authorlink=|year=2012|website=|publisher=DuPont|doi=|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recycling===
Though Tyvek superficially resembles paper (for example, it can be written and printed on), it is plastic, and it cannot be [[Recycling|recycled]] with paper. Some Tyvek products are marked with the #2 resin-code for [[HDPE]], and can be collected with plastic bottles as part of some municipal curbside recycling programs. DuPont runs a program in the United States where disposable clothing, coveralls, lab coats, medical packaging and other non-hazardous Tyvek disposable [[garment]]s can be recycled, as well as providing a mail-in recycling program for envelopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dupont.com/products-and-services/packaging-materials-solutions/industrial-packaging/articles/recycling-information.html|title=Recycling - DuPont Tyvek® for Industrial Packaging - DuPont USA|author=admin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, plastic bag recycling has become more prevalent. According to the [[American Chemistry Council]], these plastic film drop-off locations accept Tyvek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.plasticfilmrecycling.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Recycling-Reach-Study-2012.pdf|title=Plastic Film and Bag Recycling Collection: National Reach Study|publisher=Moore Recycling Associates Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Properties of Tyvek ===
According to DuPont's Web site, the fibers are 0.5–10 [[Micrometre|&amp;#xB5;m]] (compared to 75&amp;nbsp;µm for a human hair). The nondirectional fibers (plexifilaments) are first spun and then bonded together by heat and pressure, without binders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dupont.com/content/dam/dupont/products-and-services/fabrics-fibers-and-nonwovens/industrial-fabrics/documents/DPT_Tyvek_Product_Handbook.pdf Product Handbook for DuPont Tyvek]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyvek is also:

* Light weight
* Class 1 [[flammability]] rating
* Chemical resistant
* Dimensional stabilized
* [[Opacity (optics)|Opaque]]
* Neutral [[pH]]
* Tear resistant

==Uses==

=== Construction/engineering ===

* Large sheets of Tyvek are frequently used as "[[housewrap]]," to provide an air barrier between the outer cladding of a structure and the frame, insulation, etc., allowing water vapor to pass yet restricting air infiltration.&lt;ref&gt;DuPont: [http://www.dupont.com/products-and-services/construction-materials/tyvek-building-envelopes.html Tyvek Weatherization Systems] [https://web.archive.org/web/20090228064001/http://www2.dupont.com/Tyvek_Weatherization/en_US/index.html archive] [http://www.dupont.com/content/dam/assets/products-and-services/construction-materials/assets/Architectural%20Binder/Residential%20Products%20Brochure%20K10844.pdf Pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fukushima Dai-ichi''' (''dai-ichi'' means "#1"), is a multi-[[Nuclear reactor technology|reactor]] [[Nuclear power plant|nuclear power site]] in the [[Fukushima Prefecture]] of Japan. The [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] occurred after a [[Moment magnitude scale|9.0 magnitude]] [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake and subsequent tsunami]] on 11 March 2011, only 14 days before the reactor was to be shut down. This offshore earthquake, near the island of [[Honshu Island|Honshu]],&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; produced a large [[tsunami]] in Japan, and a [[Tsunami warning system|tsunami warning]] for over 20 countries within and around the [[Pacific Rim]].

The earthquake triggered a [[scram]] shut down of the three active reactors at the [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant|Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant]] (Fukushima Dai-Ichi). The ensuing tsunami crippled the site, stopped the Fukushima I backup [[diesel generator]]s, and caused a station [[power outage|blackout]]. The subsequent [[Loss-of-coolant accident|lack of cooling]] led to explosions and [[nuclear meltdown|meltdowns]] at the Fukushima I facility, with problems at three of the six reactors and in one of the six [[Spent nuclear fuel|spent-fuel pool]]s.

===Monday, 7 March===
[[Tokyo Electric Power Company]] (TEPCO) submits a report to Japan's nuclear safety agency which predicts the possibility of a tsunami up to 10.2 metres high at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in the event of an earthquake similar to the [[1896 Sanriku earthquake|magnitude 7.2 earthquake with accompanying tsunami]] that devastated the area in 1896.  TEPCO actually made this prediction in 2008 but delayed in submitting the report because they ''"did not feel the need to take prompt action on the estimates"''.&lt;ref name="JAIF_Report_224"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1317702304P.pdf|title=Earthquake report No. 224|publisher=JAIF|date=4 October 2011|accessdate=4 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028152753/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1317702304P.pdf|archivedate=28 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikinews|8.9 magnitude earthquake hits Japan, causes tsunami}}
* 14:46: A [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|9.1 magnitude earthquake]] strikes off the coast of [[Honshu Island]] at a depth of about {{convert|24|km|mi}}. The [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant|Fukushima I]] power plant's nuclear reactors 1, 2, and 3 are automatically shut down by the tremor. Nuclear reactors 4, 5, and 6 were undergoing routine maintenance and were not operating (reactor 4 was defueled in November 2010). The tremor has the additional effect of causing the power plant to be cut off from the Japanese electricity grid; however, backup diesel generators kick in to continue cooling.

According to a report in the ''New York Times'', "... at the start of the crisis Friday, immediately after the shattering earthquake, Fukushima plant officials focused their attention on a damaged storage pool for spent nuclear fuel at the No. 2 reactor at Daiichi, said a nuclear executive who requested anonymity&amp;nbsp;... The damage prompted the plant’s management to divert much of the attention and pumping capacity to that pool, the executive added.

===Saturday, 12 March===
[[File:Fukushima accidents overview map.svg|thumb|right|Overview map showing evacuation and other zone progression and selected radiation levels.]]
* 02:44: Emergency battery power for the high pressure core-flooder system (HPCFS) for reactor 3 runs out.
* 04:15: Fuel rods in reactor 3 are exposed.
* 05:30: Despite the high risk of hydrogen (produced from the water in the containment vessel) igniting after combining with oxygen from water or in the atmosphere, and in order to release some of the pressure inside the reactor at Fukushima I unit 1, the decision is taken to vent some of the steam (which contained a small amount of radioactive material) into the air.
* 05:50: Fresh water injection into reactor 1 is started.&lt;ref name="TEPCOCore" /&gt;
* 06:50: Although unknown at the time, the core of reactor 1 has now completely melted and falls to the bottom of the reactor pressure vessel.&lt;ref name="TEPCOCore" /&gt;
* 10:09: TEPCO confirms that a small amount of vapor has been released into the air to release pressure in reactor unit 1 at Fukushima I.&lt;ref name="BBC_timeline"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12722719| title=Timeline: Japan power plant crisis|publisher=BBC News   |accessdate=15 March 2011|date=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 10:58: Pressure still remains too high inside reactor unit 2 at Fukushima I. In order to alleviate some of this pressure, a consensus is reached to once more vent radioactive vapor into the air.&lt;ref name="BBC_timeline" /&gt;
* 14:50: Fresh water injection into reactor 1 is halted.&lt;ref name="TEPCOCore" /&gt;

* 15:36: There is a massive explosion in the outer structure of unit 1. The concrete building surrounding the steel reactor vessel collapses as a result of the explosion; however no damage is believed to have been sustained to the reactor itself. Four workers are injured. {{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}
* 19:00: Seawater injection into reactor 1 is started.  TEPCO orders Daiichi to cease seawater injection at 19:25, but Daiichi plant boss [[Masao Yoshida (nuclear engineer)|Masao Yoshida]] orders workers to continue with the seawater injection.&lt;ref name="TEPCOCore" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20111130x2.html Disregard Tepco order, boss told plant workers]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 30 November 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

To release pressure within reactor unit 1 at Fukushima I, steam is released out of the unit into the air. This steam contains water vapor, hydrogen, oxygen and some radioactive material.

TEPCO engineers decided to directly inject seawater inside the pressure vessel of the reactors by means of the mobile trucks of the firemen. The pressure relief was also necessary to allow the firemen to inject seawater into the reactors vessels.

===Sunday, 13 March===

The Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission states that it "assumed" melted fuel rods in unit 2 have released radioactive substances into the coolant water, which subsequently leaked out through an unknown route to the unit 2 turbine building basement. To reduce the amount of leaking water, TEPCO reduced the amount of water pumped into the unit 2 reactor, from 16 tons per hour to 7 tons per hour, which could lead to higher reactor temperatures. The highly radioactive water halts work on restoring the cooling pumps and other powered systems to reactors 1–4.&lt;ref&gt;Nagata, Kazuaki, and Kanako Takahara, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110329a1.html Radioactive water keeps workers out]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 29 March 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; TEPCO confirms finding low levels of [[plutonium]] in five samples during 21 and 22 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=the CNN Wire Staff|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/03/28/japan.nuclear.plutonium/?hpt=T2|title=TEPCO says plutonium found on quake-damaged plant grounds|publisher=CNN|accessdate=7 April 2011|date=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enriched levels of [[Plutonium-238]], relative to [[Plutonium-239]] and [[Plutonium-240]], at two of the sites in the plant (solid waste area and field) indicate that contamination has occurred at those sites due to the "recent incident".

TEPCO begins dumping water  from storage tanks tainted with low levels of radioactivity into the Pacific Ocean on Monday night. Officials say this is needed to make room in a central waste facility to store water with a higher radioactive level. This more highly radioactive water is preventing workers from making progress on restoring the cooling and other systems to reactors 1–4.&lt;ref&gt;Takahara, Kanako, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110405a1.html Tepco dumps toxic water into sea]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 5 April 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[NHK]]'', "Discharge of radioactive water into sea continues", 5 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Samples of seawater near the plant reveal radioactive [[caesium]] at 1.1&amp;nbsp;million times the legal limit.&lt;ref name="latimes2"&gt;Hall, Kenji and Makinen, Julie, "[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-japan-nuclear-20110406,0,2697428.story]", "[[Los Angeles Times]]", 5 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company says it could release up to 11,500 tons of radioactive water into the sea. A spokeswoman for Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency says the less-contaminated water must be disposed of so that workers can secure a place to store more highly contaminated water on the site.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt;

Most of the workers at the nuclear plant were evacuated.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Official measures at Fukushima I reactor unit 1, however, show a rise in temperature following the aftershock and a spiking amount of radiation in the Dry Well, which exceeds the instrument maximum of 100 Sv/h.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atmc.jp/plant/rad/?n=1 |title=Unit 1 nuclear power plant Fukushima Radiation |publisher=TEPCO |accessdate=8 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408070037/http://atmc.jp/plant/rad/?n=1 |archivedate=8 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauge B, in the meantime, records a steady increase in pressure for the previous ten days in the same reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atmc.jp/plant/vessel/?n=1 |title=Unit 1 nuclear power plant Fukushima Pressure |publisher=TEPCO |accessdate=8 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410002940/http://atmc.jp/plant/vessel/?n=1 |archivedate=10 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Reporting the rise to 100 Sv/h from the earlier 30 Sv/h, TEPCO declares that the "validity of the measurement is questioned" both for radiation levels and pressure.

Japan still struggles to keep water on the reactors to cool them and prevent further meltdown. Russian [[Antonov An-124]] cargo planes fly out of Atlanta and Los Angeles, each carrying a huge concrete boom pump. The two 95-ton boom pumps, which TEPCO purchased for $2million each, can be operated from two miles away by remote control. Each boom pump can direct focused streams of water into the damaged reactors.&lt;ref name="Longbottom"&gt;Longbottom, Wil.

Prior to the elevation to level 7 by the Japanese authorities [[James M. Acton|James Acton]], Associate of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, was of the opinion that "Fukushima is not the worst nuclear accident ever but it is the most complicated and the most dramatic, {{sic|This}} was a crisis that played out in real time on TV. Chernobyl did not."&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110414005117/http://in.ibtimes.com/articles/132391/20110409/japan-nuclear-crisis-radiation.htm "Analysis: A month on, Japan nuclear crisis still scarring,"] ''International Business Times'' (Australia). 9 April 2011.

A survey of radiation in seawater outside unit 2 shows radioactive isotope concentrations ([[iodine-131]], [[caesium-134]] and [[caesium-137]]) falling for the third consecutive day since the leak was plugged.

Coolant injection into reactors 1 and 3 is interrupted for 50 minutes due to a loss of power after a strong earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2011/04/84640.html |title=Restoration work at Fukushima plant suffers setback in Monday quake |agency=Kyodo News   |accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workers plan to pump water into turbine condensers, but need to pump water out of them first. Work to transfer water from the unit 2 and unit 1 condensers to a central storage tank was completed on 9 and 10 April. Workers have also knocked holes through the turbine hall buildings of units 2 and 4 to accommodate hoses for the water transfer. At unit 3, work continues to make space for water in the turbine condenser by pumping existing water into other tanks. Japanese news wire NHK reports that workers are laying hoses to transfer water to an LLW waste processing facility, which continues to be inspected. TEPCO says that it cannot start work switching on emergency systems on site until the turbine hall is dry. NHK also reported that radioactive water filling a tunnel near unit 2 has risen 12&amp;nbsp;cm since a leak in a trench was stopped on Wednesday 6 April.&lt;ref name="neimagazine1"/&gt;

Following the hydrogen explosion in the reactor 1 building on 12 March and releases from the reactor 3 building, the equivalent of 190,000 terabecquerels of radioactive iodine had been released from the reactor buildings by 15 March, according to calculations by the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan. A terabecquerel is equivalent to 1&amp;nbsp;trillion becquerels. The high level meant that by 15 March the Fukushima plant accident had already reached the worst level 7 on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale, matching the assessment given to the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=High radiation levels detected at Fukushima grounds a month after explosions|date=26 April 2011|url=http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201104250130.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time the Fukushima reactors have continued to emit radiation; including atmospheric, water, and gamma ray releases.

At Chernobyl, approximately 10 times the amount of radiation was released into the atmosphere as was released from Fukushima I through 12 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tran, Mark|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/12/japan-fukushima-chernobyl-crisis-comparison|title=Nuclear crises: How do Fukushima and Chernobyl compare?|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=12 April 2011|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The total amount of radioactive material still stored at Fukushima is about 8 times that stored at Chernobyl, and leakage at Fukushima continues.

===Friday, 15 April===
Nuclear fuel is reported to have melted and fallen to the lower containment sections of reactors 1, 2 and 3. The melted material is not expected to breach a container (which might cause a massive radiation release). Instead, the melted fuel is thought to have dispersed fairly uniformly across the lower portions of the containers of the three reactors, which would make the resumption of the fission process, to the extent of a [[criticality accident|recriticality]] accident, 'most unlikely';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecuritynewswire.org/gsn/nw_20110415_5020.php |title= Japan plant fuel melted partway through reactors: Report |publisher=Globalsecuritynewswire.org |date=15 April 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it is only during future dismantling of the three damaged reactors that it would be possible to verify this hypothesis and to know what really occurred inside the reactor cores.

The Associated Press reports that two [[PackBot]] ground robots from [[iRobot]] have entered unit 1 and unit 3 of the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant and performed temperature, pressure, and radioactivity measurements. The remote-controlled robots entered the two reactors over the preceding weekend. The devices opened closed doors and explored the insides of the reactor buildings, coming back with radioactivity readings of up to 49&amp;nbsp;mSv/h inside unit 1 and up to 57&amp;nbsp;mSv/h inside unit 3. TEPCO officials say that the radiation data from the robots do not change their plans for shutting down the plant by the end of this year. Though more robots will be used, a TEPCO official, Takeshi Makigami, says that robots are limited in what they can do, and eventually "people must enter the buildings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/robots-enter-fukushima-reactors-detect-high-radiation |title=Robots enter Fukushima reactors, detect high radiation – IEEE Spectrum |publisher=Spectrum.ieee.org |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robots also entered unit 2, but the probe was hindered by fogging of the robot's camera lens from the high humidity, over 90%, inside the building.&lt;ref name="jaif.or.jp-1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1305711249P.pdf |title=Earthquake Report No. 85 |publisher=JAIF |date=18 May 2011 |accessdate=18 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011180610/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1305711249P.pdf |archivedate=11 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TEPCO engineers confirm that a meltdown occurred, with molten fuel having fallen to the bottom of the reactor's containment vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/8509502/Nuclear-meltdown-at-Fukushima-plant.html |title=Nuclear meltdown at Fukushima plant |date=12 May 2011|author=Julian Ryall |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The utility says fuel rods of the No.&amp;nbsp;1 reactor are fully exposed with the water level 1&amp;nbsp;meter (3.3&amp;nbsp;feet) below the base of the fuel assembly. The government and TEPCO are described as "''consistently appeared to be underestimating the severity of the situation.''" According to a Japanese press report, there are holes in the base of the pressure vessel, and most of the fuel has likely melted. The nuclear fuel has possibly leaked into the containment vessel, which was damaged by an explosion during the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-12/japan-suffers-setback-at-fukushima-after-no-1-reactor-s-fuel-rods-exposed.html |title=Japan Reactor-Core Damage Worse Than Thought |date=12 May 2011|author=Joe Carroll and Michio Nakayama |publisher=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the [[Nuclear Energy Institute]], a nuclear lobbying firm, states that the situation "''is in no way alarming.

A robot sent to the first floor of unit 1 records a radiation level of 2,000 mSv/h. At this level, workers would only be allowed to stay in the area for 8 minutes. In addition, the reactor's containment vessel is leaking large amounts of water into the basement. A TEPCO worker is able to peer into the basement and determines that the 11&amp;nbsp;m deep basement is approximately half full of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/15/japan-nuclear-idUSL4E7GF00T20110515 |publisher=Reuters |title=Japan readies new tactics for Fukushima after setback |date=15 May 2011 |accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is reported that 22 out of 23 radiation monitoring systems around the Fukushima plants were disabled by the earthquake and tsunami. Some were directly damaged, but most were disabled due to communication and power lines being cut. Even monitors equipped with backup satellite links failed, probably due to antenna damage. In [[Miyagi prefecture]], 4 out of 7 were disabled by the tsunami, with the remaining three stopping after three hours. In [[Ibaraki Prefecture|Ibaraki]], some 40 monitors stopped working for three hours until power could be restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kyodo|title=Power outages, downed communication lines knocked out most radiation monitoring systems in disaster areas|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110529a4.html|accessdate=29 May 2011|newspaper=The Japan Times |date=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of the typhoons of the season is due to strike the area, while Japan states radiation levels at the seabed are several hundreds of times above normal levels off the coast of Fukushima.

TEPCO reports that a new computer simulation of the meltdown shows nuclear fuel rod material melting through the pressure vessel and deep inside the concrete of the primary containment vessel, within a foot of breaching it fully in Reactor No. 1. In the pessimistic scenario, all of the fuel of Reactor No. 1 has escaped the pressure vessel, as well as a majority of the fuel for Reactor No. 2 and 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20111201a1.html|title=Containment vessels held: simulation test|publisher=The Japan Times Online|accessdate=5 December 2011|date=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|US Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] Chairman [[Gregory Jaczko]], visiting Japan, confirmed that the Daiichi reactors were stable.  Said Jaczko, "The temperatures have decreased significantly, the amount of heat that's being produced from the reactor fuel itself is very, very low now.  So it simply doesn't have the kind of energy, if you will, that's needed to have any kind of off-site releases of radiation.

=== Monday, 26 December ===
An interim report was issued by the investigative panel headed by Yotaro Hatamura.  In the report, the panel concluded that poor internal communication by the Japanese government and faulty knowledge and actions by TEPCO employees contributed to the disaster.  The Japanese cabinet was not informed of the government's System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information, which could have told them of the wind direction's effect on the spread of radiation, which would have allowed them to make better decisions on which areas to evacuate around Fukushima Daiichi.  TEPCO workers mistakenly believed that the isolation condenser for reactor No. 1 was still working, when it was not, delaying efforts to try other methods to cool the reactor.  TEPCO workers turned off an emergency cooling system on reactor No. 3 for seven hours to try to switch to another system that was not working, allowing the reactor to overheat more quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Nagata, Kazuaki, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20111226x1.html Report blasts government's crisis response]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 27 December 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt is made to view the state of the melted fuel in reactor 2 using a fibre-optic endoscope, however clear images of the water level and fuel location could not be obtained, probably due to the harsh environment inside the containment vessel.&lt;ref name="JAIF_Report_323"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New video of Fukushima nuclear reactor interior|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16649030|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 January 2012|date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After radioactive water was discovered in a tunnel under reactor 2 on 18 December, the government directed TEPCO to survey the plant's underground facilities and check for more accumulation of radioactive water.

=== 03 February===
TEPCO said the radiation level in the containment vessel of reactor 2 at the crippled Fukushima No. 1 power plant was 530 sieverts per hour, the highest recorded level since the triple core meltdown in March 2011. This is however the first measurement of the radiation level within the reactor area and as such is likely lower than in the initial period after the meltdown. TEPCO also announced that there is a 2-meter hole under the pressure vessel in the reactor’s primary containment vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/02/03/national/tepco-finds-gaping-hole-grate-containment-vessel-potential-fuel-debris-fukushima-no-1-power-plant/|title=Highest radiation reading since 3/11 detected at Fukushima No. 1 reactor|publisher=

=== 20 June===
A recent investigation by TEPCO using temperature measurements has determined the probable location of the cores for reactors 1–3.  They believe that most of the core debris has breached the pressure vessel and lays at the bottom of the containment vessel for reactors 1 and 3, although some debris seems to be lodged in the control rod drive mechanism for reactor 1.  However, they believe that most debris may remain at the bottom of the pressure vessel for reactor 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jaif.or.jp/en/new-data-obtained-on-debris-locations-based-on-temperature-changes-using-reduced-injections-of-water/|title=New Data Obtained on Debris Locations Based on Temperature Changes Using Reduced Injections of Water|publisher=

=== 26 September ===

A revised decommissioning roadmap has the removal of fuel rods from reactor 3 storage pool starting in 2018, but the removal of fuel rods from the reactor 1 and 2 storage pools will be delayed until 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201709260025.html|title=3-year delay in removal of fuel rods from Fukushima plant|publisher=The Asahi Shimbun|author=Chikako Kawahara|date=2017-09-26|accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Removal of melted fuel debris from one of the reactors is expected to begin by 2021.

=== 15 February===

A robot with two "fingers" makes first contact with the fuel debris in the primary containment vessel (PCV) of reactor 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jaif.or.jp/en/tepco-makes-contact-with-debris-at-fukushima-daiichi-2/|title=TEPCO Makes Contact with Debris at Fukushima Daiichi-2|publisher=JAIF|author=Noriyuki Ishii|date=2019-02-15|accessdate=2019-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The robot was able to move loose debris at 7 of the 10 locations probed, providing hope that it may be possible to remove these deposits from the PCV.

'''''Surviving the Tsunami - My Atomic Aunt''''' is a 2013 [[documentary film]] written, directed, and co-produced by Kyoko Miyake remembers the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] nuclear disaster that occurred on March 11, 2011 by focusing on how the disaster has affected her home town of [[Namie, Fukushima]], Japan. The film develops into a personal reflection on how the Fukushima disaster has affected not only the world, but Miyake herself and the family she once knew. 	

==Director==

After obtaining her degree in English History from the [[University of Tokyo]], Kyoko Miyake moved to England to study English Witchcraft at [[Oxford University]] as a Swire Centenary Scholar.&lt;ref name="Film Director Always Looking… "&gt;Umehara, Toshiya. "KYOKO MIYAKE: Film Director Always Looking for the Truth." The Asahi Shimbun. The Asahi Shimbun Company, 21 Mar. 2014. Web. &lt;http://ajw.asahi.com/article/globe/people/AJ201403210010&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BritDoc"&gt;"My Atomic Aunt." BritDoc. The BRITDOC Foundation, 1 Apr. 2013. Web. &lt;http://britdoc.org/real_films/puma_awards_directory/my-atomic-aunt&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While on sabbatical from her doctoral program at Oxford, Miyake began to create historically themed independent documentary films. Her inspiration for her first international feature-length documentary, Surviving the Tsunami, came from her familial connection to the Japanese city of Namie, which had to be completely evacuated after the meltdown of the Fukushima Number One nuclear plant, and her anger at the way the disaster was being portrayed by the larger, mainstream media outlets.&lt;ref name="Film Director Always Looking…" /&gt; Kyoko has directed award winning documentaries including Hackney Lullabies, which have been screened in Berlin, Germany, London, England and Sydney, Australia. Kyoko Miyake currently resides in England.&lt;ref name=BritDoc /&gt;

==Synopsis==
''Surviving the Tsunami'' brings together social, environmental, and personal perspectives of the national catastrophe of the Fukushima nuclear meltdown. In the documentary, Kyoko Miyake travels back to her hometown in Namie, Fukushima, to revisit her old life and assess the trauma still lingering from the disaster.&lt;ref name="First Hand Films "&gt;"Surviving the Tsunami - My Atomic Aunt."

The film also follows Bunsei Watanabe and Kyoko Miyake's Aunt Kuniko, two people who hope for the rejuvenation of Namie, despite the disaster that has occurred.&lt;ref name="Film Director Always Looking…" /&gt; Despite having lost family, friends, and jobs due to the meltdown and subsequent fear of the contamination zone, these two individuals are determined to rebuild their towns and neighborhoods and bring back the sense of community they once had. The film follows the residents of Namie, with emphasis on the experiences of Aunt Kuniko, as they come to terms with the reality of living in or near the "radiation zone" left in the wake the plant's nuclear meltdown.&lt;ref name="First Hand Films" /&gt; Surviving the Tsunami offers a different perspective on Japanese culture, national identity, human adaption, and global nuclear energy and proliferation.&lt;ref&gt;Women Make Movies.

==Production== 
The documentary was originally titled ''Beyond the Wave,'' yet the completed documentary was released as ''My Atomic Aunt.'' 
The film aired on seven television networks around the world in 2013, including the [[BBC]], and [[NHK]], Japan's National public broadcasting organization.&lt;ref name="Film Director Always Looking…" /&gt;

Jon Lynes, of ''Time Out London'', describes ''Surviving the Tsunami'', as "Haunting and moving ... as hard-hitting as it is simply presented... a timely reminder that the impact of the Fukushima disaster is still being felt....".&lt;ref&gt;Lynes, Jon.

'''''3.11: Surviving Japan''''' is a [[documentary film]] about the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] and the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] in [[Japan]] written and directed by volunteer and resident Christopher Noland.

== Synopsis ==
The film spans from March 11, 2001 to September 19, 2011, starting with Noland's own experience in the [[Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]], [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] followed by volunteer activities in [[Ōfunato, Iwate|Ofunato]]&lt;ref name="imaginepeace1"&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate = 20 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
After meeting with volunteers and residents of the affected region that stated huge oversights in the disaster management, Noland continued to volunteer while going on an investigative journey through the [[Tōhoku region]].  He set out to [[Minamisōma, Fukushima]] near the crippled [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]] to speak to the Mayor who had appeared on YouTube&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70ZHQ--cK40 |title=SOS from Mayor of Minami Soma City, next to the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant, Japan |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a distress call that the [[Japanese Government]] had neglected the town during the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]]. He then returned north to the [[Miyagi Prefecture]] to interview officials about the crisis management of the tsunami victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a-_nDTcgU0 |title=Scene from "Surviving Japan " Sendai City Disaster prevention office |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-11-03 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While on the same food delivery mission that May, he met a woman in [[Ishinomaki, Miyagi|Ishinomaki]] that had been denied food and shelter stating she felt "thrown away as a Japanese citizen&lt;ref name="youtube1"&gt;{{cite web

By August Noland saw another distress call from [[Minamisōma, Fukushima|Minamisōma]] again on YouTube, this time from a city councilman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSvfro1Hwco |title=SOS Again from Minamisoma, Fukushima (en) |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-07-18 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noland contacted the councilman through the volunteer network and arranged a meeting after checking on citizens affected by high levels of [[Radiation]] in [[Fukushima, Fukushima|Fukushima city]] and [[Kōriyama, Fukushima|Kōriyama]].  It was Noland's conclusion that despite everything, the most important thing was the children's safety in the [[Radioactive contamination]] and further awareness of the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] that he felt the media had ignored.

Making appearances in the film are [[Helen Caldicott]], founder of [[Physicians for Social Responsibility|PSR]]; [[Cham Dallas|professor Cham Dallas]] a disaster management specialist; Kimiaki Toda, Mayor of [[Ōfunato, Iwate|Ofunato]]; [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]], owner and operator of [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]]; Katsunobu Sakurai, Mayor of [[Minamisōma, Fukushima|Minamisōma]] and Kouichi Oyama, City Councilman of [[Minamisōma, Fukushima|Minamisōma]].

== Production ==
''[[imdbtitle:2262171|3.11: Surviving Japan]]'' was conceived, directed, filmed and narrated by Christopher Noland.  Executive producer was [[Simon Hilton]]; producers were [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0452963/#producer Q'orianka Kilcher], Dave Parrish and Christopher Noland; Cinematographer was Christopher Noland; editing was done by Christopher Noland, MB X. McClain and Andrea Hale; sound editor and mixer [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1383608/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr22 Scott Delaney]; Soundtrack contribution of "Kurushi" by [[Yoko Ono]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The documentary was made in exactly one year.  Noland began the project as a one-man crew until September when he was joined by MB X. McClain to edit over 100 hours of footage down to 180 minutes until Noland moved back to the United States in late November to finish post-production with editor Andrea Hale. Noland credits the moral support of [[Yoko Ono]], [[Simon Hilton]], and [http://www.imaginepeace.com Imaginepeace.com] for their undying support during his one-man production.&lt;ref name="imaginepeace1"/&gt;

''[[imdbtitle:2262171|3.11: Surviving Japan]]'' had its first pre-screening at [[Simon Fraser University]] on March 10, 2012 for the one-year anniversary of the disaster.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The plant [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|suffered major damage]] from the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami]] that hit Japan on March 11, 2011. The chain of events caused radiation leaks and permanently damaged several reactors, making them impossible to restart. By political decision, the remaining reactors were not restarted. 

First commissioned in 1971, the plant consists of six [[boiling water reactor]]s. These [[light water reactor]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.jnes.go.jp/atom-db/en/general/atomic/ke02a13/info_f.html |title=Tokyo Electric Power Co.

Fukushima was the first nuclear plant to be designed, constructed and run in conjunction with [[General Electric]] and [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]] (TEPCO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201104060126.html|title=The Asahi Shimbun|publisher=|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}{{dl|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The March 2011 disaster disabled the reactor cooling systems, leading to releases of radioactivity and triggering a 30&amp;nbsp;km evacuation zone surrounding the plant; the releases continue to this day. On April 20, 2011, the Japanese authorities declared the 20&amp;nbsp;km evacuation zone a no-go area which may only be entered under government supervision.

In April 2012, Units 1-4 were decommissioned. Units 2-4 were decommissioned on April 19, while Unit 1 was the last of these four units to be decommissioned on April 20 at midnight.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} In December 2013 TEPCO decided none of the undamaged units will reopen.

The sister nuclear plant [[Fukushima II Nuclear Power Plant|Fukushima Daini]] ([[dai-ichi#Related phrases|"number two"]]), {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}} to the south, is also run by TEPCO. It also suffered serious damages during the tsunami, especially at the seawater intakes of all four units, but could be shut down and brought to a safe state through [[Fukushima Daini Nuclear Power Plant#2011 earthquake and tsunami |extraordinary actions]] by the plant crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Fukushima Daiichi Accident |date=2015-08-31 |publisher=IAEA - International Atomic Energy Agency |location=Wienna |isbn=978-92-0-107015-9 |pages=131-132 |url=https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/AdditionalVolumes/P1710/Pub1710-TV1-Web.pdf |accessdate=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Please note: there is a short section on the earthquake effects below and a separate article on that subject at Fukushima I accidents.

The reactor's emergency diesel generators and DC batteries, crucial components in helping keep the reactors cool in the event of a power loss, were located in the basements of the reactor turbine buildings. The reactor design plans provided by General Electric specified placing the generators and batteries in that location, but mid-level engineers working on the construction of the plant were concerned that this made the backup power systems vulnerable to flooding. TEPCO elected to strictly follow General Electric's design in the construction of the reactors.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida, Reiji, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2011/07/14/national/ge-plan-followed-with-inflexibility GE plan followed with inflexibility]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', July 14, 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Site layout===
[[File:Fukushima I NPP 1975 medium crop rotated labeled.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the plant area in 1975, showing separation between Units 5 &amp; 6, and the majority of the complex&lt;br&gt;・Unit 6: direction of [[Sōma, Fukushima|Sōma]]&lt;br&gt;・Unit 4: direction of [[Iwaki, Fukushima|Iwaki]]]]
The plant is on a bluff which was originally 35 meters above sea level. During construction, however, TEPCO lowered the height of the bluff by 25 meters. One reason for lowering the bluff was to allow the base of the reactors to be constructed on solid bedrock in order to mitigate the threat posed by earthquakes. Another reason was the lowered height would keep the running costs of the seawater pumps low. TEPCO's analysis of the tsunami risk when planning the site's construction determined that the lower elevation was safe because the sea wall would provide adequate protection for the maximum tsunami assumed by the design basis. However, the lower site elevation did increase the vulnerability for a tsunami larger than anticipated in design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Fukushima plant site originally was a hill safe from tsunami | url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110712x2.html |work=The Japan Times  | accessdate=September 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fukushima Daiichi site is divided into two reactor groups, the leftmost group - when viewing from the ocean - contains units 4, 3, 2 and 1 going from left to right. The rightmost group - when viewing from the ocean - contains the newer units 5 and 6, respectively, the positions from left to right. A set of seawalls protrude into the ocean, with the water intake in the middle and water discharge outlets on either side.

===Reactor data===
Units 7 and 8 were planned to start construction in April 2012 and 2013 and to come into operation in October 2016 and 2017 respectively. The project was formally canceled by TEPCO in April 2011 after local authorities questioned the fact that they were still included in the supply plan for 2011, released in March 2011, after the accidents. The company stated that the plan had been drafted before the earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;Asahi.

===Electrical connections===
The Fukushima Daiichi plant is connected to the power grid by four lines, the 500&amp;nbsp;kV Futaba Line (双葉線), the two 275&amp;nbsp;kV Ōkuma Lines (大熊線) and the 66&amp;nbsp;kV Yonomori Line (夜の森線) to the Shin-Fukushima (New Fukushima) substation.

The Shin-Fukushima substation also connects to the Fukushima Daini plant by the Tomioka Line (富岡線). Its major connection to the north is the Iwaki Line (いわき幹線), which is owned by [[Tohoku Electric Power]]. It has two connections to the south-west that connect it to the Shin-Iwaki substation (新いわき).

===Operating history===
[[File:HD.15.055 (11839699333).jpg|thumb|Plant still under construction circa 1971]]
The plant reactors came online one at a time beginning in 1970 and the last in 1979. From the end of 2002 through 2005, the reactors were among those shut down for a time for safety checks due to the [[Tokyo Electric Power Company#Scandal|TEPCO data falsification scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Heavy fallout from Japan nuclear scandal |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/BUSINESS/asia/09/02/japan.tepco/index.html |accessdate=March 15, 2011 |publisher=CNN |date=September 2, 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315065851/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/BUSINESS/asia/09/02/japan.tepco/index.html |archivedate=March 15, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cooke&gt;{{Cite book | publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]| first = Stephanie | last = Cooke| year= 2009| page = 388| title= [[In Mortal Hands: A Cautionary History of the Nuclear Age]]| isbn = 978-1-59691-617-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 28, 2011, TEPCO submitted a report to the Japanese [[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency]] admitting that the company had previously submitted fake inspection and repair reports.

On April 5, 2011, TEPCO vice president Takashi Fujimoto announced that the company was canceling plans to build Reactors No. 7 and 8.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]'', "TEPCO to drop plan to add two reactors at Fukushima nuclear plant", April 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Andrew, ''[[Washington Post]]'', "March 26:  More reactors sought for plant?", ''[[Japan Times]]'', April 7, 2011, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 20 TEPCO's board of directors' officially voted to decommission Units 1 through 4 of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and to cancel plans to build units 7 and 8. It refused however to make a decision regarding units 5 and 6 of the station or units 1 to 4 of the Fukushima Daini nuclear power station until a detailed investigation is made. In December 2013 TEPCO decided to decommission the undamaged units 5 and 6; they may be used to test remote clean-up methods before use on the damaged reactors.&lt;ref name="nei-20131219"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newstepco-will-decommission-fukushima-daiichi-56-4149387 |title=TEPCO will decommission Fukushima Daiichi 5&amp;6 |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=19 December 2013 |accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warnings and design critique==
In 1990, the U.S. [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) ranked the failure of the emergency electricity generators and subsequent failure of the cooling systems of plants in seismically very active regions one of the most likely risks. The Japanese [[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency]] (NISA) cited this report in 2004. According to Jun Tateno, a former NISA scientist, TEPCO did not react to these warnings and did not respond with any measures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-16/japan-s-reactor-risk-foretold-20-years-ago-in-u-s-nuclear-agency-s-report.html Makiko Kitamura, Maki Shiraki (Bloomberg, 16. März 2011): ''Japan's Reactor Risk Foretold 20 Years Ago in U.S. Agency Report'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmmaker [[Adam Curtis]] mentioned the risks of the type of [[boiling water reactor]]s cooling systems such as those in Fukushima I,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Adam Curtis |title=A Is For Atom |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/2011/03/a_is_for_atom.html | work=British Broadcasting Corporation | date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed the risks were known since 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/34/34395/1.html |title=Notkühlprobleme von Fukushima-Reaktoren seit 1971 bekannt |author=Ralf Streck |publisher=Heise Zeitschriften Verlag |work=[[Telepolis]] |date=March 22, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xcyTaLqC?url=http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/34/34395/1.html |archivedate=April 1, 2011 |accessdate=April 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a series of documentaries in the BBC in 1992 and advised that [[Pressurized water reactor|PWR type]] reactors should have been used.

[[Tokyo Electric Power Company|TEPCO]], that operated the station, had been warned their seawall was insufficient to withstand a powerful tsunami, but the seawall height was not increased in response. While other stations run by the [[Tohoku Electric Power]] company had much more robust seawalls (such as the [[Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant]]) down the coast closer to the epicenter of the earthquake, the Fukushima Plant did not.

==Incidents and accidents==

===Prior to March 2011===

====1978====
Fuel rods fell in reactor No. 3, causing a nuclear reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704396504576204461929992144?mod=WSJ_topics_obama|date=March 16, 2011|title=Plant's Design, Safety Record Are Under Scrutiny|author=NORIHIKO SHIROUZU and REBECCA SMITH|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took about seven and a half hours to place the rods back into proper positions.&lt;ref&gt;Ikuko Kao, [http://uk.reuters.com/article/2007/03/22/japan-tepco-nuclear-idUKT16854920070322 Japan's TEPCO admits 1978 nuclear criticality], Reuters, March 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====February 25, 2009====
A manual shutdown was initiated during the middle of a start-up operation. The cause was a high pressure alarm that was caused by the shutting of a turbine bypass valve. The reactor was at 12% of full power when the alarm occurred at 4:03&amp;nbsp;am (local time) due to a pressure increase to 1,030 psi (7,100 kPa), exceeding the regulatory limit of 1,002 psi (6,910 kPa). The reactor was reduced to 0% power, which exceeded the 5% threshold that requires event reporting, and pressure dropped back under the regulatory limit at 4:25&amp;nbsp;am. Later, at 8:49&amp;nbsp;am the control blades were completely inserted, constituting a manual reactor shutdown. An inspection then confirmed that one of the 8 bypass valves had closed and that the valve had a bad driving fluid connection. The reactor had been starting up following its 25th regular inspection, which had begun on October 18, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Tepco official release (Japanese).[http://www.tepco.co.jp/cc/press/09022501-j.html Manual shutdown during reactor startup operations in Fukushima I-1]. February 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

====March 26, 2009====
Unit 3 had problems with over-insertion of control blades during outage. Repair work was being done on equipment that regulates the driving pressure for the control blades, and when a valve was opened at 2:23&amp;nbsp;pm a control blade drift alarm went off. On later inspection, it was found that several of the rods had been unintentionally inserted.&lt;ref&gt;Tepco official release (Japanese). [http://www.tepco.co.jp/cc/press/09032602-j.html Over-insertion of control rods in Fukushima I-3].&lt;/ref&gt;

====November 2, 2010====
Unit 5 had an automatic [[SCRAM]] while an operator was conducting an adjustment to the [[control blade]] insertion pattern. The [[SCRAM]] was caused by a reactor low water level alarm. The turbine tripped along with the reactor and there was no radiation injury to workers.&lt;ref&gt;Tepco official release (Japanese). [http://www.tepco.co.jp/cc/press/10110201-j.html Fukushima I-5 Automatic SCRAM Information].&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 2011, an [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake categorized as 9.0 M&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;]] on the [[moment magnitude scale]] occurred at 14:46 [[Japan Standard Time]] (JST) off the northeast coast of Japan, one of the most powerful earthquakes in history. Units 4, 5 and 6 had been "shut down" prior to the earthquake for planned maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Black |first=Richard |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12745186 |title=Reactor breach worsens prospects |publisher=BBC News |date= March 15, 2011|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.noypi.ph/index.php/nation/3295-government-scientists-on-japan-nuke-meltdown-no-need-to-worry.html | title = Government Scientists on Japan Nuke Meltdown "No need to worry" | accessdate =March 14, 2011 | publisher=Noypi.ph | author=Biela Liwag}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining reactors were shut down/[[SCRAM]]ed automatically after the earthquake, and the remaining decay heat of the fuel was being cooled with power from emergency generators. The subsequent destructive [[tsunami]] with waves of up to 14 meters that over-topped the station, which had seawalls, disabled emergency generators required to cool the reactors and [[Spent fuel pool]]s in Units 1-5. Over the following three weeks there was evidence of partial [[nuclear meltdown]]s in units 1, 2 and 3: visible explosions, suspected to be caused by hydrogen gas, in units 1 and 3; a suspected explosion in unit 2, that may have damaged the primary containment vessel; and a possible uncovering of the [[Spent fuel pool]]s in Units 1, 3 and 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nisa.meti.go.jp/english/files/en20110327-2-2.pdf|title=Conditions of Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Station Unit 2 as of 14:00 March 27, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=February 7, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523050242/http://www.nisa.meti.go.jp/english/files/en20110327-2-2.pdf|archivedate=May 23, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Units 5 &amp; 6 were reported on March 19, by the station-wide ''alert log updates'' of the [[IAEA]], to have gradually rising spent fuel pool temperatures as they had likewise lost offsite power, but onsite power provided by Unit 6's two diesel generators that had not been flooded, were configured to do double-duty and cool both Unit 5 and 6's spent fuel pools "and cores".&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/press/?p=1463|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607091828/http://www.iaea.org/press/?p=1463|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 7, 2011|title=Japanese Earthquake Update (19 March 2011, 4:30 UTC) : IAEA Alert Log: Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident|date=June 7, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a precautionary measure, vents in the roofs of these two units were also made to prevent the possibility of hydrogen gas pressurization and then ignition.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

Radiation releases from Units 1-4 caused large evacuations, concern about food and water supplies, and treatment of nuclear workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9M59PR00.htm Anxiety in Tokyo over radiation in tap water]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KN1&gt;{{cite web|url = http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2011/03/78123.html | title= Radiation leak feared at nuke plant, people urged to stay indoors|publisher=[[Kyodo News Agency]]|date=March 15, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316145026/http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2011/03/78123.html|archivedate=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WNN24&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[World Nuclear News]]|date=March 24, 2011|title=Exposures and progress at Fukushima Daiichi|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS_Exposures_and_progress_at_Fukushima_Daiichi_240311.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiation releases also contaminated the 2011 harvest.

The events at units 1, 2 and 3 have been rated at Level 5 each on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]], and those at unit 4 as Level 3 (Serious Incident) events, with the overall plant rating at Level 7 (major release of radioactive material with widespread health and environmental effects requiring implementation of planned and extended countermeasures).&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/2011/fukushimafull.html|title=Japan Earthquake Update|date=March 19, 2011&lt;!--, 4:30 UTC)--&gt;|work=[[IAEA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====April 3, 2011====
2 bodies were discovered in the basement turbine room, most likely because the workers ran there during the tsunami.

====April 9, 2013====
Radioactive water leaked from the storage units, minimally contaminating the [[soil]] and [[water]] nearby. The leak was controlled and stored in a contained area. The stored water continues to require maintenance, until its ultimate purification.&lt;ref&gt;RussiaToday.

====July 9, 2013====
[[TEPCO]] officials reported that radioactive [[caesium]] was 90 times higher than it was 3 days prior (July 6), and that it may spread into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. TEPCO reported that the caesium-134 levels in the well water were measured at 9 kilobecquerel per liter, 150 times the legal level, while [[Caesium-137]] was measured at 18 kilobecquerel per liter, 200 times the permitted level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Black |first=Richard |url=http://rt.com/news/radiation-levels-soar-fukushima-839/|title=Radioactive cesium level soars 90-fold at Fukushima in just 3 days}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====August 7, 2013====

'''Safecast''' is an international, volunteer-centered organization devoted to open [[citizen science]] for the environment. Safecast was established by Sean Bonner, Pieter Franken, and [[Joi Ito]] shortly after the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] in Japan, following the [[Tōhoku earthquake]] on 11 March 2011 and manages a global [[open data]] network for [[ionizing radiation]] monitoring.

The Safecast team, with help of International Medcom, Tokyo [[Hackerspace]] and other volunteers, has designed various [https://github.com/Safecast/General/wiki/Safecast-Devices devices] for radiation mapping. These include the bGeigie and bGeigie Nano for mobile applications (carborne and walking measurements) as well as fixed stations called Pointcast.

All data are collected via the [http://api.safecast.org/ Safecast API] and are presented on the publicly available interactive [http://safecast.org/tilemap/ Safecast Tile Map].

Safecast later expanded to offer [[air quality]] sensors which also report open [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] maps.

==bGeigie Nano==
Safecast bGeigie Nano is a portable radiation detector equipped with a [[Geiger-Mueller tube]] type detector, built-in GPS and logging to microSD card.

The bGeigie Nano is available as a kit, so the user needs to learn how to solder in order to build it from the supplied parts. The kit can be purchased from the [https://kithub.cc/safecast/ Kithub product page]. The device was developed in collaboration with International Medcom Inc. and shares some parts with their [https://medcom.com/product/imi-inspector-alert-surface-contamination-meter/ Inspector Alert™] detector. According to the [https://github.com/Safecast/bGeigie-transitional Safecast Github page] ''"bGeigie Nano is a lighter version of the bGeigie Mini using an Arduino Fio, a GpsBee, an OpenLog and an Inspector Alert geiger counter. The aim is to make everything fit in a Pelican Micro Case 1040"''.
The final version of the bGeigie is placed inside the smaller Pelican Micro Case 1010. It features the [http://www.lndinc.com/products/17/ LND 7317] pancake [[Geiger-Mueller tube]] type detector, a GPS receiver and is expandable with a Bluetooth module. The mode switch offers choice between geotagged radiation logging (data saved to microSD card) and measuring without GPS - showing also Bq/m2 (Cs137) values. Inside the case the unit is calibrated for gamma radiation. The main unit taken out of its case will additionally do α- and β-detection for careful use as a surface contamination spot meter.

The '''Fukushima disaster cleanup''' is an ongoing attempt to limit [[radioactive contamination]] from the three nuclear reactors involved in the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] which followed the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011]].
The affected reactors were adjacent to one another and accident management was made much more difficult because of the number of simultaneous hazards concentrated in a small area. 
Failure of emergency power following the tsunami resulted in loss of coolant from each reactor, hydrogen explosions damaging the reactor buildings, and water draining from open-air [[spent fuel pool]]s. 
Plant workers were put in the position of trying to cope simultaneously with [[nuclear meltdown|core meltdowns]] at three reactors and exposed fuel pools at three units.

Automated cooling systems were installed within 3 months from the accident. 
A fabric cover was built to protect the buildings from storms and heavy rainfall. 
New detectors were installed at the plant to track emissions of [[xenon]] gas. 
Filters were installed to reduce contaminants from escaping the area of the plant into the area or atmosphere. 
Cement has been laid near to the seabed to control contaminants from accidentally entering the ocean.

No [[strontium]] was released into the area from the accident;&lt;ref name="ajw.asahi.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201209130060 |title=Survey finds zero Fukushima plant strontium contamination in soil samples - AJW by The Asahi Shimbun |publisher=Ajw.asahi.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212004541/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201209130060 |archivedate=2013-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update-inline|date=March 2017}} however, in September 2013 it was reported that the level of strontium-90 detected in a drainage ditch located near a water storage tank from which around 300 tons of water was found to have leaked was believed to have exceeded the threshold set by the government.&lt;ref name="mainichi.jp"&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (13 September 2013) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130913p2g00m0dm041000c.html Toxic water has leaked into Pacific Ocean: TEPCO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915205527/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130913p2g00m0dm041000c.html |date=2013-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
At the time of the initial event, 50 [[TEPCO]] employees remained onsite in the immediate aftermath to work to stabilize the plant and begin cleanup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='I am one of the Fukushima fifty': One of the men who risked their lives to prevent a catastrophe shares his story |author=David McNeill |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/i-am-one-of-the-fukushima-fifty-one-of-the-men-who-risked-their-lives-to-prevent-a-catastrophe-shares-his-story-8517394.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=2 March 2013 |accessdate=5 March 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, TEPCO did not put forward a strategy to regain control of the situation in the reactors. Helmut Hirsch, a German physicist and nuclear expert, said "they are improvising with tools that were not intended for this type of situation".&lt;ref name=Hackenbroch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,754868,00.html |title=A hapless Fukushima clean-up effort |author=Veronika Hackenbroch, Cordula Meyer and Thilo Thielke |date=5 April 2011 |work=Der Spiegel}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 17 April 2011, TEPCO appeared to put forward the broad basis of a plan which included: (1) reaching "cold shutdown in about six to nine months;" (2) "restoring stable cooling to the reactors and spent fuel pools in about three months;" (3) putting "special covers" on Units 1, 3, and 4 starting in June;(4) installing "additional storage containers for the radioactive water that has been pooling in the turbine basements and outside trenches;"&lt;ref name="spectrum.ieee.org"&gt;[http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/energy/nuclear/tepco-announces-a-roadmap-to-restoration-at-fukushima-dai-1 TEPCO Announces a "Roadmap to restoration" at Fukushima Dai-1 - IEEE Spectrum].

Cold shutdown was accomplished on December 11, 2011. From that point cooling was no longer required, but maintenance was still required to control large water leaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brumfiel|first=Geoff|title=Fukushima reaches cold shutdown|journal=Nature|date=December 11, 2011|doi=10.1038/nature.2011.9674|url=http://www.nature.com/news/fukushima-reaches-cold-shutdown-1.9674|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204336104577096281099680526|accessdate=10 April 2013|title=After Nuclear Milestone, a Long Road|newspaper=Asia Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long term plans for Units 5 and 6 have not been announced, "but they too may need to be decommissioned".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Tabuchi, Hiroko [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/world/asia/15cleanup.html?_r=2 Nuclear cleanup plans hinge on unknowns], NY Times, 14 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 May 2011, workers were able to enter reactor buildings for the first time since the accident.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13289877 Workers enter reactor building], NHK, 5 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The workers began to install air filtration systems to clean air of radioactive materials to allow additional workers to install water cooling systems.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Scope of cleanup==

Japanese reactor maker Toshiba said it could decommission the earthquake-damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant in about 10 years, a third quicker than the American Three Mile Island plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13023213 |title= Japan: Minister in first tour of stricken nuclear plant |publisher=BBC News |date=9 April 2011 |accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a comparison, at Three Mile Island the vessel of the partially melted core was first opened 11 years after the accident, with cleanup activities taking several more years.

TEPCO announced it restored the automated cooling systems in the damaged reactors in about three months, and had the reactors put into cold shutdown status in six months.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110418a1.html Reactor shutdowns nine months away]", ''Japan Times, 18 April 2011.''&lt;/ref&gt;

First estimates included costs as high as {{JPY|1 trillion}} ({{USD|13 billion}}), as cited by the Japanese Prime Minister at the time, [[Yoshihiko Noda]] (野田 佳彦). However, this estimate was made before the scope of the problem was known. It seems that the contamination was less than feared. No strontium is detectable in the soil,&lt;ref name="ajw.asahi.com"/&gt; and though the crops of the year of the disaster were contaminated, the crops produced by the area now are safe for human consumption.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"/&gt;

Japan's economy, trade, and industry ministry recently ({{as of|2016|lc=yes}}) estimated the total cost of dealing with the Fukushima disaster at {{JPY|21.5 trillion}} ({{USD|187 billion}}), almost twice the previous estimate of {{JPY|11 trillion}} ({{USD|96 billion}}). A rise in compensation for victims of the disaster from {{JPY|5.4 trillion}} ({{USD|47 billion}}) to {{JPY|7.9 trillion}} ({{USD|69 billion}}) was expected, with decontamination costs estimated to rise from {{JPY|2.5 trillion}} ({{USD|22 billion}}) to {{JPY|4 trillion}} ({{USD|35 billion}}), costs for interim storage of radioactive material to increase from {{JPY|1.1 trillion}} ({{USD|10 billion}}) to {{JPY|1.6 trillion}} ({{USD|14 billion}}), and costs of decommissioning reactors to increase from {{JPY|2 trillion}} ({{USD|17 billion}}) to {{JPY|8 trillion}} ({{USD|69 billion}}).&lt;ref name="the-mainichi-dec2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=2.4 trillion yen in Fukushima crisis compensation costs to be tacked onto power bills|url=http://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20161210/p2a/00m/0na/002000c|accessdate=10 March 2017|work=Mainichi Daily News|publisher=The Mainichi|date=10 December 2016|language=en|quote=At the meeting, the ministry also revealed that the estimated cost of dealing with the disaster has hit 21.5 trillion yen -- nearly double the initial projection of 11 trillion yen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Total compensation for people affected by the disaster is estimated to rise from 5.4 trillion yen to 7.9 trillion yen, and decontamination-associated costs are likely to grow from 2.5 trillion yen to 4 trillion yen. The bill for building interim storage facilities for radioactive materials is expected to rise from 1.1 trillion yen to 1.6 trillion yen, while that of decommissioning reactors at the crippled plant will likely surge from 2 trillion yen to 8 trillion yen.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working conditions at the plant==

There has been concern that the plant would be dangerous for workers. Two workers suffered skin burns from radiation, but no serious injuries or fatalities have been documented to have been caused by radiation at Fukushima Dai-ichi.

===Unskilled workforce systematically employed on Japanese nuclear power plants===
The disaster in Fukushima has revealed the practice of Japanese nuclear power plants systematically using unskilled laborers with short contracts. These people are paid per day, and are hired per day from questionable agencies and firms. From data provided by NISA, it was concluded that 80 percent of all of the workforce hired in commercial nuclear power plants is done using temporary contracts, In Fukushima this number was even higher, at 89 percent. This had been practiced for decades. Unemployed people gathered in parks in the morning, and were picked up to be taken to the nuclear power plants. They would get a contract for a few months to do unskilled and the most dangerous labor. After the work was finished, these people were supposed to disappear.&lt;ref&gt;(dutch) AD (6 September 2011) [http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1013/Buitenland/article/detail/2893265/2011/09/06/Fukushima-brengt-uitbuiting-in-kerncentrales-aan-het-licht.dhtml Slave-labor in Japanese nuclear power-plants ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workers in dorms exposed to radiation===
Two shelters for people working at the Fukushima-site were not listed as part of the radiation management zones although radiation levels in the shelters exceeded the legal limits. The consequence was, that the workers did not get paid the extra "danger allowance" that was paid to workers in these "radiation management zones". The shelters were constructed by [[Toshiba Corporation]] and the [[Kajima Corporation]] at a place some 2 kilometers west of the damaged reactors, just outside the plant compound, but quite near to the reactors 1 to 4. The shelters were built after the shelters at the plant-compound became overcrowded. At 7 October 2011 radiation levels in the Toshiba building were between 2 and 16 [[sievert|microsieverts]] per hour, in the Kajima dorm it was 2 to 8.5 microsieverts per hour. The Industrial Safety and Health Law on the prevention of health damage through ionizing radiation had set the limit for accumulated radiation dosage in radiation management zones at 1.3 millisieverts over three months, so the maximum level is 2.6 microsieverts/hour. In both dorms the radiation levels were higher. However, these doses are well below the level to affect human health. According to the law, the "business operator" is responsible for 
"managing radiation dosage and the prevention of contamination", Toshiba and Kajima said that TEPCO was responsible. But a TEPCO official made the comment: "From the perspective of protecting workers from radiation, the business operators (that constructed the shelters) are managing radiation dosage and the prevention of contamination" in this way suggesting that Toshiba and Kajima had to take the care for the zone management.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (31 October 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111031p2a00m0na009000c.html Workers in shelters just outside gates of nuclear complex miss out on allowance]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031184800/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111031p2a00m0na009000c.html |date=October 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preventing hydrogen explosions==
On 26 September 2011, after the discovery of hydrogen in a pipe leading to the containment vessel of reactor no.1, NISA instructed TEPCO to check whether hydrogen was building up in reactor no. 2 and 3 as well. TEPCO announced that measurements of hydrogen would be done in reactor no. 1, before any nitrogen was injected to prevent explosions. When hydrogen would be detected at the other reactors, nitrogen injections would follow.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (26 September 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1317010815P.pdf Earthquake-report 216: Hydrogen check ordered at No.2, 3 reactors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028172841/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1317010815P.pdf |date=2011-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the discovery of hydrogen concentrations between 61 and 63 percent in pipes of the containment of reactor no. 1, nitrogen injections were started on 8 October. On 10 October TEPCO announced, that the concentrations were at that moment low enough to prevent explosions, and even if the concentration would rise again, it would not exceed 4 percent, the lowest level that would pose the risk of an explosion. On the evening of 9 October two holes were drilled into the pipe to install a filter for radioactive substances inside the containment vessel, this was 2 weeks behind the schedule TEPCO had set for itself. This filter should be in operation as soon as possible.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (10 October 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1318217190P.pdf Earthquake-report 230: Hydrogen level falls at Fukushima plant ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106122353/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1318217190P.pdf |date=2011-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations inside the reactors==
On 19 January 2012 the interior of the primary containment vessel of reactor 2 was inspected with an industrial endoscope. This device, 8.5 millimeters in diameter, is equipped with a 360 degrees-view camera and a thermometer to measure the temperature at this spot and the cooling-water inside, in an attempt to calibrate the existing temperature-measurements that could have an error-margin of 20 degrees. The device was brought in by a hole at 2.5 meter above the floor where the vessel is located. The whole procedure lasted 70 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily news (19 January 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120119p2g00m0dm104000c.htm TEPCO uses endoscope to look inside crippled Fukushima reactor ] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120715121104/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120119p2g00m0dm104000c.htm |date=2012-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The photos showed parts of the walls and pipes inside the containment vessel. But they were unclear and blurred, most likely due to water vapors and the radiation inside. According to TEPCO the photos showed no serious damage. The temperature measured inside was 44.7 degrees Celsius, and did not differ much from the 42.6 degrees measured outside the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (20 January 2012)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1327033033P.pdf Earthquake-report 323: TEPCO fails to clearly see inside damaged reactor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516160456/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1327033033P.pdf |date=2013-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;nu.nl (20 January 2012) [http://www.zie.nl/video/algemeen/Tepco-filmt-in-getroffen-kerncentrale/m1fz512f27na TEPCO films in reactor 2 (footage comments in Dutch)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inspections of the suppression chambers reactor no. 2 and 3===
On 14 March 2012 for the first time after the accidents six workers were sent into the basements of reactor no. 2 and 3, to examine the suppression chambers.  Behind the door of suppression chamber in the no.2 building 160 millisieverts/hour was measured. The door to the suppression chamber in the no. 3 reactor building was damaged and could not be opened. In front of this door the radiation level measurement was 75 millisieverts/hour. For reactors to be decommissioned, access to the suppression chambers is vital for conducting repairs to the containment structures. Because the high levels of radiation, according to TEPCO this work should be done with robots, because these places could be hostile to humans. TEPCO released some video footage of the work at the suppression chambers of the No. 2 and 3 reactors.&lt;ref name="www3.nhk.or.jp"&gt;NHK-world (15 March 2012)[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12740843 Radiation high near suppression chambers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JAIF 2012"&gt;JAIF (15 March 2012)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1331791439P.pdf Earthquake report 374: Radiation high near suppression chambers]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 and 27 March 2012 the inside of the containment vessel of reactor 2 was inspected with a 20 meter long endoscope. With this a dosi-meter was brought into the vessel to measure the radiation levels inside. At the bottom of the primary containment structure, 60 centimeters of water was found, instead of the 3 meters expected at that place. The radiation level measured was 72.9 sieverts per hour. Because of this, the endoscope could only function a few hours at this place. For reactors number 1 and 3, no endoscopic survey was planned at that time, because the actual radiation levels at these places were too high for humans.&lt;ref name="www3.nhk.or.jp"/&gt;{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;ref name="JAIF 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (28 March 2012)[https://archive.is/20130221030444/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/national/archive/news/2012/03/28/20120328p2g00m0dm010000c.html Fukushima No. 2 reactor radiation level up to 73 sieverts per hour ] &lt;/ref&gt;

== Management of contaminated water ==
{{Update|section|date=February 2017}}
{{Organize section|date=February 2017}}

Continued cooling of the melted reactor cores is required in order to remove excess heat. Due to damage to the integrity of the reactor vessels, radioactive water accumulated inside the reactor and turbine buildings.

The Japanese government had initially requested the assistance of the [[Russia]]n floating water decontamination plant ''[[Landysh]]'' to process the radioactive water from the damaged reactors, but negotiations with the Russian government were an extremely slow process and it is unclear if the plant was ever sent to Fukushima. ''Landysh'' was built by Russia with funding from Japan to process liquid wastes produced during the [[nuclear decommissioning|decommissioning]] of [[nuclear submarines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Russia floating nuclear waste plant ready to depart for Japan |url=http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=16134586&amp;PageNum=0 |newspaper=ITAR TASS |date=8 April 2011 |accessdate=11 April 2011}} {{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of early September 2011 the operating rate of the filtering system exceeded the target of 90 percent for the first time. 85,000 tons of water were decontaminated by September 11, with over 100,000 tons of waste-water remaining to be treated at the time. However, the nuclear waste generated by the filters had already filled almost 70 percent of the 800 cubic meters of storage space available at the time. TEPCO had to figure out how to cool the reactors with less than 15 tons of water per day in order to reduce the growth of waste-water and nuclear waste to more manageable levels.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (11 September 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1315713074P.pdf Earthquake-Report 201: Challenges to contain nuclear accident]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Installation of circulating water cooling system ===
[[File:Fukushima I nuclear accident diagram 1.svg|thumb|Side view of the Fukushima trenches and tunnels. 1: Reactor building, 2: Turbine generator and associated condenser.]] 
In order to remove decay heat of the severe damaged cores of Unit 1-3, TEPCO injected cooling water into the reactors. As the reactors appear to have holes around the bottom, the water dissolved the water-soluble fission products, which then accumulated in the basement of the turbine building (the adjacent diagram #2) through any leaks from the water-injected reactor buildings (#1). Since the accumulated radioactive water was a risk, TEPCO tried to transfer it.

As the accumulated water in the basement (see the tunnel below diagram #2) of the turbine building of Units 2 and 3 was radioactive, TEPCO needed to remove it. They had initially planned to pump the water to the condenser (the large black vessel in diagram #1).&lt;ref name="a11"&gt;"Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident Update (27 March, 03:00 UTC)".

=== Removal of accumulated water in seawater piping trench ===
The Fukushima Daiichi NPS has several [[Utility tunnel|seawater piping trenches]] which were originally designed to house pipes and cables running from the Unit 2&amp;ndash;4 turbine buildings to their seaside, which doesn't directly connect to the sea. Inside the trench, radioactive contaminated water has been accumulating since the accident. Due to the risk of soil or ocean contamination from these trenches, TEPCO has been trying to remove the accumulated water in the trenches by pumping it back into the turbine buildings, as well as backfilling the trenches to reduce or prevent further incursion of contaminated water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/decommision/planaction/trench/index-e.html TEPCO:Seawater Piping Trench]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Groundwater contamination===
On 5 July 2013, TEPCO found 9 kBq/L of &lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs and 18 kBq/L of &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs in a sample taken from a monitoring well close to the coastline. Compared with samples taken three days earlier, the levels were 90 times higher. The cause was unknown. The monitoring well is situated close to another monitoring well that had previously leaked radioactive water into the sea in April 2011. A sample of groundwater from another well situated about 100 meters south of the first well showed that the radioactivity had risen by 18 times over the course of 4 days, with 1.7 kBq/L of strontium and other radioactive substances.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (08 July 2013) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130709p2g00m0dm075000c.html Groundwater contamination level soars at Fukushima plant]&lt;/ref&gt; A day later the readings in the first well were 11 kBq/L of &lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs and 22 kBq/L of &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs, 111 times and 105 times greater than the samples of 5 July. TEPCO did not know the reasons for the higher readings, but the monitoring was to be intensified.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (10 July 2013)[http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130710p2g00m0dm036000c.html Cesium readings further climb in groundwater at Fukushima plant]&lt;/ref&gt;

More than a month after the groundwater contamination was discovered, TEPCO started to contain the radioactive groundwater. They assumed that the radioactivity had escaped early in the beginning of the disaster in 2011, but NRA experts{{who|date=February 2017}} had serious doubts about their assumption. According to them, other sources could not be excluded. Numerous pipes were running everywhere on the reactor grounds to cool the reactors and decontaminate the water used, and leaks could be anywhere. TEPCO's solution resulted in redirection of the groundwater flows, which could have spread the radioactive contamination further. Besides that, TEPCO had plans for pumping groundwater.{{elucidate|date=February 2017}} At that time the turbine buildings of units 2 and 3 contained 5000 and 6000 cubic meters of radioactive water. With wells in contact with the turbine-buildings, this could spread the radioactivity into the ground. The NRA announced that it would form a task force to find the leaks and to block the flow of the groundwater to the coastline, because the NRA suspected that the groundwater was leaking into the sea.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (11 July 2013) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130711p2a00m0na010000c.html Radioactive water at Fukushima plant 'strongly suspected' of seeping into sea: NRA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714164622/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130711p2a00m0na010000c.html |date=2013-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Asahi Shimbun (12 July 2013)[http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201307120076 Strontium detected in well on seaward side of Fukushima plant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130716012312/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201307120076 |date=2013-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Asahi Shimbun (13 July 2013) [http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201307130066 TEPCO's plan to halt spread of radioactive water based on shaky theory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717041532/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201307130066 |date=2013-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radioactive waste==
Cooling the reactors with recirculated and decontaminated water from the basements proved to be a success, but as a consequence, this radioactive waste was piling up in the temporary storage facility at the plant. TEPCO decided in the first week of October to use the "Sally" decontamination system built by Toshiba Corporation and keep the Kurion/Areva system as back-up.

On 27 September after three months operation some 4,700 drums with radioactive waste had piled up at the plant. The Kurion and Sally systems both utilized [[zeolite]]s to concentrate cesium. After the zeolite was saturated, the vessels with the zeolite were turned into nuclear waste. By now, 210 Kurion-made vessels with a total of 307 cubic meters, each vessel measuring 0.9 meters in diameter and 2.3 meters in height had accumulated at the plant. The Areva-filters used sand to absorb radioactive materials and chemicals were used to reactivate the filters. In this way, 581 cubic meters of highly contaminated sludge were produced.

According to Professor Akio Koyama of the Kyoto University Research Reactor Institute, the density of high-level decontaminated water was believed to contain 10 gigabecquerel per liter, but if this is condensed to polluted sludge and zeolites, this density could increase 10,000 fold. These densities could not be dealt using conventional systems.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily news (3 October 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111003p2a00m0na011000c.html Radioactive waste piles up at Fukushima nuclear plant as disposal method remains in limbo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005154826/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111003p2a00m0na011000c.html |date=2011-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spent fuel pools===
On August 16, 2011, TEPCO announced the installation of desalination equipment in the spent fuel pools of reactor 2, 3 and 4. These pools had been cooled with seawater for some time, and TEPCO feared the salt would corrode the stainless steel pipes and pool wall liners. The Unit 4 spent fuel pool was the first to have the equipment installed, the spent fuel pools of reactor 2 and 3 came next. TEPCO expected to achieve removal of 96% of the salt in the spent fuel pools within two months.&lt;ref&gt;''Jaif'' (August 16, 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1313555883P.pdf Desalinisation of spent fuel pools ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818045427/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1313555883P.pdf |date=2011-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unit 4 spent fuel removal====
On December 22, 2014, TEPCO crews completed the removal of all fuel assemblies from the spent fuel pool of reactor 4. 1331 spent fuel assemblies were moved to the ground-level common spent fuel pool, and 204 unused fuel assemblies were moved to the spent fuel pool of reactor 6 (Unit 4 was out of service for refueling at the time of the 2011 accident, so the spent fuel pool contained a number of unused new fuel assemblies).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/2014/1246703_5892.html |title=FUEL REMOVAL FROM UNIT 4 REACTOR BUILDING COMPLETED AT FUKUSHIMA DAIICHI |publisher=www.tepco.co.jp |accessdate=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debris removal==
On 10 April 2011, TEPCO began using remote-controlled, unmanned heavy equipment to remove debris from around reactors 1–4. The debris and rubble, caused by hydrogen explosions at reactors 1 and 3, was impeding recovery operations both by being in the way and emitting high radioactivity. The debris will be placed into containers and kept at the plant.&lt;ref&gt;''NHK'', "TEPCO Uses Unmanned Equipment To Remove Rubble", 10 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed building protections==
{{update|section|date=August 2011}}

Because the [[monsoon]] season begins in June in Japan, it became urgent to protect the damaged reactor buildings from [[storm]]s, [[typhoon]]s and heavy rainfall. As a short term solution, TEPCO envisaged to apply a light cover on the remaining structures above the damaged reactors.  As of mid-June, TEPCO released its plan to use automated cranes to move structures into place over the reactor.  This strategy is an attempt to keep as many people away from the reactors as possible, while still covering the damaged reactors.&lt;ref name="The Guardian Newspapaer"&gt;{{cite news|title=TEPCO unveils plan to seal Fukushima reactors|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2011/jun/15/tepco-plan-seal-fukushima-reactors-video|accessdate=6 August 2011 | location=London|work=The Guardian|date=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proposed Sarcophagus ===
On 18 March 2011, Reuters reported&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Saoshiro, Shinichi |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/03/18/us-japan-fortimeline-march-idUKTRE72H5TG20110318|title=Japan weighs need to bury nuclear plant; tries to restore power |agency=Reuters |date=18 March 2011|accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Hidehiko Nishiyama, Japan's nuclear agency spokesman when asked about burying the reactors in sand and concrete, said: "That solution is in the back of our minds, but we are focused on cooling the reactors down." Considered a last-ditch effort since it would not provide cooling, such a plan would require massive reinforcement under the floor, as for the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/8392154/Japan-nuclear-crisis-scientists-consider-burying-Fukushima-in-a-Chernobyl-sarcophagus.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|author=Alleyne, Richard|title=Japan nuclear crisis: scientists consider burying Fukushima in a 'Chernobyl sarcophagus'|date=19 March 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scrapping reactor Daiichi 1, 2, 3, 4===
On 7 September 2011, TEPCO president Toshio Nishizawa said that the 4 damaged reactors will be scrapped. This announcement came at a session of the Fukushima Prefectural Assembly, which was investigating the accident at the plant. Whether the six other remaining reactors, (Daiichi 5, 6, Daini 1, 2, 3, 4) should be abolished too, would be decided based on the opinions of local municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (7 September 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1315463095P.pdf Nishizawa:TEPCO to scrap Fukushima reactors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419005430/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1315463095P.pdf |date=2012-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 October 2011, the [[Japanese Atomic Energy Commission]] presented a timetable in a draft report titled, ''“how to scrap the Fukushima reactors”''. Within 10 years, a start should be made with the retrieval of the melted fuel within the reactors. First, the containment vessels of reactors 1, 2 and 3 should be repaired, then all should be filled with water to prevent radiation releases. Decommissioning would take more than 30 years, because the pressure vessels of the reactor vessels are damaged also. After the [[Three Mile Island accident|accident at Three Mile Island]] in 1979, some 70 percent of the fuel rods had melted. There, the retrieval of the fuel was started in 1985, and completed in 1990. The work at Fukushima was expected to take significantly longer because of the far greater damage and the fact that 4 reactors would need to be decommissioned all at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (28 October 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/28_31.html Fuel retrieval at Fukushima to start in 10 years ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028184804/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/28_31.html |date=2011-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (29 October 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1319860744P.pdf Earthquake-report 249: Fuel retrieval at Fukushima to start in 10 years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517073954/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1319860744P.pdf |date=2013-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After discussions were started in August 2011, on 9 November, a panel of experts of Japan's Atomic Energy Commission completed a schedule for scrapping the damaged reactors - their conclusions were;

* The scrapping will take 30 years or longer.
* First, the containment vessels needed to be repaired, then filled with water to block radiation.
* The reactors should be in a state of stable cold shutdown.
* Three years later, a start would be made to take all spent fuel from the 4 damaged reactors to a pool within the compound.
* Within 10 years, the removal of the melted fuel inside the reactors could begin.

This scheme was partly based on the experience gained from the 1979 Three Mile Island accident. However, in Fukushima with three meltdowns at one site, the damage was much more extensive. It could take 30 years or more to remove the nuclear fuel, dismantle the reactors, and remove all the buildings.
Research institutions all over the world were asked to participate in the construction of a research-site to examine the removal of fuel and other nuclear wastes. The official publication of the report was planned at the end of 2011.&lt;ref name="Earthquake-report 261"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NHK-world 2011"&gt;NHK-world (9 November 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/09_28.html Commission releases report on scrapping N-plant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213203958/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/09_28.html |date=2011-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protection systems installed==
Since the disaster, TEPCO has installed sensors, a fabric cover over the reactors and additional filters to reduce the emission of contaminants.

===Sensors for xenon and temperature changes to detect critical reactions===
After the detection of radioactive xenon gas in the containment vessel of the No. 2 reactor on 1 and 2 November 2011 TEPCO was not able to determine whether this was a sustained fission process or only spontaneous fission. Therefore TEPCO installed detection devices for radioactive xenon to single out any occurrence of nuclear criticality. Next to this TEPCO installed temperature sensors to control temperature changes in the reactors, another indicator of possible critical fission reactions.&lt;ref name="Earthquake-report 261"&gt;JAIF (10 November 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1320900681P.pdf Earthquake-report 261]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (10 November 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/10_14.html TEPCO to monitor xenon at Fukushima plant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112193829/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/10_14.html |date=2011-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New filters===
On 20 September the Japanese government and TEPCO announced the installation of new filters to reduce the amount of radioactive substances released into the air. In the last week of September 2011 these filters were to be installed at reactor 1, 2 and 3. Gases out of the reactors would be decontaminated before they would be released into the air. Mid October the construction of the polyester shield over the No.1 reactor should be completed. In the first half of September the amount of radioactive substances released from the plant was about 200 megabecquerel per hour, according to TEPCO, that was about one-four millionths of the level of the initial stages of the accident in March.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Fabric cover over Unit 1===
An effort has been undertaken to fit the three damaged reactor buildings with fabric covers and filters to limit radioactive contamination release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/03/31/3178263.htm|title=Reactor feared in meltdown, radiation spreads|publisher=ABC News|date=30 March 2011|accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 April 2011, sources told Kyodo News that a major construction firm was studying the idea, and that construction wouldn't "start until June". The plan has been criticized for potential only having "limited effects in blocking the release of radioactive substances into the environment".&lt;ref name="kyodonews4"&gt;[http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2011/04/83374.html Radiation-shielding sheets to be installed in September at earliest, Kyodo News]. English.kyodonews.jp. Retrieved on 30 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May, TEPCO announced that it had begun to clear debris to create a space to install a cover over the building of reactor 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/14_02.html |title=TEPCO to cover No.1 reactor building |publisher=NHK |date=14 May 2011 |accessdate=2 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513220611/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/14_02.html |archivedate=May 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, a large crane was erected near Reactor 1 to begin construction of the fabric cover. From mid August to mid September 2011, a rectangular steel frame entirely surrounding the reactor building was constructed. Starting 9 September, the crane was used to attach polyester panels to the frame. On 20 September 2011, TEPCO announced that within three weeks they hoped to complete the construction of the polyester shield over the No.1 reactor. By that time the steel frame for the fabric cover had been completed. By 7 October, the roof of the structure was being added. On 9 October, the walls of the cover appeared to be placed, and by 13 October the roof had been completed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;JAIF (20 September 2011 [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1316578041P.pdf Earthquake-report 211: A new plan set to reduce radiation emissions ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Based on archived video of the plant from TEPCO&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (20 September 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1316481545P.pdf Steel Frame for Unit 1 Reactor Building Cover is Complete] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419005604/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1316481545P.pdf |date=2012-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metal cover over Unit 3===
In June 2016, preparation work began to install a metal cover over the Unit 3 reactor building. In conjunction with this, a crane is to be installed to assist with the removal of the fuel rods from the storage pool. After inspection and cleaning, the removed fuel is expected to be stored in the site's communal storage facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS-Test-run-for-Fukushima-Daiichi-3-cover-installation-1306164.html|title=Test run for Fukushima Daiichi 3 cover installation|publisher=World Nuclear News|date=13 June 2016|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2018 the dome-shaped roof had been completed in preparation of the removal of the fuel rods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20180221_19/ |author= |title=Kukushima plant reactor gets new roof cover| publisher=NHK Newsline |date=February 20, 2018 |accessdate=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleanup of neighboring areas==
Significant efforts are being taken to clean up radioactive material that escaped the plant. This effort combines washing down buildings and scraping away topsoil. It has been hampered by the volume of material to be removed and the lack of adequate storage facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110827p2a00m0na013000c.html Hot-spot cleanups hampered by public resistance to local disposal sites - The Mainichi Daily News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827224801/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110827p2a00m0na013000c.html |date=August 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a concern that washing surfaces will merely move the radioactive material without eliminating it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110827p2a00m0na012000c.html No quick way to remove radioactive substances from soil: experts - The Mainichi Daily News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827224803/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110827p2a00m0na012000c.html |date=August 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an earlier decontamination-plan only to clean all areas with radiation levels above 5 millisievert per year, had raised protests, the Japanese government revealed, on 10 October 2011, in a meeting with experts, a revised decontamination plan. This plan included:
* all areas with radiation levels above 1 millisievert per year would be cleaned.
* no-entry zones and evacuation zones designated by the government would be the responsibility of the government.
* the rest of the areas would be cleaned by local authorities.
* in areas with radiation levels above 20 millisievert per year, decontamination would be done step by step.
* within two years, radiation levels between 5 and 20 millisieverts should be cut down to 60%.
* the Japanese government would help local authorities with disposing the enormous amount of radioactive waste.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (10 October 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1318301925P.pdf Earthquake-report 231: Decontamination-plan compiled] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106113804/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1318301925P.pdf |date=2011-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December 2011 the Japanese Ministry of Environment published more details about these plans for decontamination: the work would be subsidized in 102 villages and towns. Opposition against the plan came from cattle-farmers in the prefecture [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]] and the tourist-industry in the city of [[Aizuwakamatsu]], because of fears that cattle sales might drop or tourism would be hurt to the town, when the areas would be labeled to be contaminated. Areas with lower readings complained that their decontamination would not be funded.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (20 December 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1324357922P.pdf Earthquake report 296: Govt to designate nuclear clean-up areas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103225504/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1324357922P.pdf |date=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Reuters story from August 2013, it was noted "[m]any have given up hope of ever returning to live in the shadow of the Fukushima nuclear plant. A survey in June showed that a third of the former residents of Iitate, a lush village famed for its fresh produce before the disaster, never want to move back. Half of those said they would prefer to be compensated enough to move elsewhere in Japan to farm." In addition, despite being allowed to return home, some residents say the lack of an economy continues to make the area de facto unlivable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Knight |first=Sophie |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/08/14/japan-decontamination-fukushima-idINDEE97D0G220130814 |title=Japan's nuclear clean-up: costly, complex and at risk of failing &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=In.reuters.com |date= 14 August 2013|accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compensation payments to those who have been evacuated are stopped when they are allowed to return home, however, as of August 2013 decontamination of the area has progressed more slowly than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130808p2a00m0na013000c.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130821145939/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130808p2a00m0na013000c.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 21, 2013 |accessdate=August 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been revelations of additional leaks (see above: storage tanks leaking contaminated water).

===Cementing the seabed near the water-intake===
On 22 February 2012 TEPCO started cementing the seabed near the plant to prevent the spread of radioactive materials into the sea. Some 70000 square meters of seabed around the intake of cooling water would be covered with 60 centimeters thick cement. The work should be finished within 4 months time, and prevent the spread of contaminated mud and sand at that place for at least 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (22 February 2012)[http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/society.html Seabed near nuke plant to be covered with cement]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127083730/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/society.html |date=November 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New definition of the no-entry-zones introduced===
On 18 December 2011 Fukushima Gov. Yuhei Sato and representatives of 11 other municipal governments near the plant were notified at a meeting at the city of Fukushima the three ministers in charge of handling the crises, Yokio Edano, minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, Goshi Hosono, nuclear disaster minister, and Tatsuo Hirano, minister in charge of reconstruction of the government plan to redesign the classification of the no-entry-zones around the Fukushima nuclear plant. From 1 April 2012 a three level system would be introduced, by the Japanese government:

; no-entry zones, with an annual radiation exposure of 50 millisieverts or more
: at these places habitation would be prohibited
; zones with annual radiation exposures between 20-50 millisievert
: here former residents could return, but with restrictions
; zones with exposures of less than 20 millisievert per year
: in these zones the residents would be allowed to return to their houses

Decontamination efforts were planned in line with this newly designed order, to help the people to return to places where the radiation levels would be relatively low.&lt;ref&gt;The Daily Yomiuri (18 December 2011) [https://archive.is/20130218155931/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T111217003401.htm Govt speeds rezoning of contaminated areas] &lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs of the clean-up operations===
Mid December 2011 the local authorities in [[Fukushima prefecture|Fukushima]] had spent already around 1.7 billion yen ($21 million) on the costs of decontamination-works in the cities of [[Fukushima, Fukushima|Fukushima]] and [[Date, Fukushima|Date]] and the village of [[Kawauchi, Fukushima|Kawauchi]]. The total clean-up costs were estimated around 420 billion yen (~ $5.2 billion).{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} For the clean-up only 184.3 billion yen was reserved in the September supplementary budget of prefecture Fukushima, and some funds in the central government's third supplementary budget of 2011. Whenever needed the central government would be asked for extra funding.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (21 December 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111221p2a00m0na017000c.html Fukushima local decontamination costs bust estimates]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221193028/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111221p2a00m0na017000c.html |date=December 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[University of Oxford]] researcher and author Peter Wynn Kirby wrote that the government had allocated the equivalent of US$15 billion for the regional cleanup and described the josen (decontamination) process, with "provisional storage areas (kari-kari-okiba) ... [and] more secure, though still temporary, storage depots (kari-okiba)". Kirby opined the effort still would be better called "transcontamination" because it was moving the contaminated material around without long-term safe storage planned or executed. He also saw little progress on handling the more intense radiation waste of the destroyed power-plant site itself; or on handling the larger issue of the national nuclear program's waste, particularly given the earthquake-risk of Japan relative to secure long-term storage.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, Peter Wynn, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/08/opinion/playing-pass-the-parcel-with-fukushima.html "Playing Pass the Parcel With Fukushima"], New York ''Times'' [[OpEd]], March 7, 2016. Retrieved 2016-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lessons learned to date==
The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster revealed the dangers of building multiple nuclear reactor units close to one another. This proximity triggered the parallel, chain-reaction accidents that led to hydrogen explosions blowing the roofs off reactor buildings and water evaporating from open-air [[spent fuel pool]]s—a situation that was potentially more dangerous than the loss of reactor cooling itself. Because of the proximity of the reactors, Plant Director Masao Yoshida "was put in the position of trying to cope simultaneously with core meltdowns at three reactors and exposed fuel pools at three units".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/02/29/0096340212440359.full.pdf+html |title=Fukushima in review: A complex disaster, a disastrous response |author=Yoichi Funabashi and Kay Kitazawa |date=March 1, 2012 |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''radiation effects from the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]]''' are the observed and predicted effects  as a result of the release of radioactive isotopes from the [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant|Fukushima Daiichii Nuclear Power Plant]] following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 Tōhoku 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami]] (Great East Japan Earthquake and the resultant tsunami).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kumangai, A. &amp; Tanigawa, K.

Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.pref.fukushima.lg.jp/site/portal-english/en03-08.html&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; Large quantities of radioactive particles from the incident, including [[iodine-131]] and [[caesium-134]]/[[caesium-137|137]], have since been detected around the world. Substantial levels have been seen in California and in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seattletimes.nwsource.com"/&gt;

[[The World Health Organization]] (WHO) released a report that estimates an increase in risk for specific cancers for certain subsets of the population inside the Fukushima Prefecture. A 2013 WHO report predicts that for populations living in the most affected areas there is a 70% higher risk of developing thyroid cancer for girls exposed as infants (the risk has risen from a lifetime risk of 0.75% to 1.25%), a 7% higher risk of leukemia in males exposed as infants, a 6% higher risk of breast cancer in females exposed as infants and a 4% higher risk, overall, of developing solid cancers for females.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh 2013"/&gt;

Preliminary dose-estimation reports by WHO and the [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] (UNSCEAR) indicate that, outside the geographical areas most affected by radiation, even in locations within Fukushima prefecture, the predicted risks remain low and no observable increases in cancer above natural variation in baseline rates are anticipated.{{sfn|WHO|2013|p=8}} In comparison, after the Chernobyl accident, only 0.1% of the 110,000 cleanup workers surveyed have so far developed leukemia, although not all cases resulted from the accident.&lt;ref name="Zablotska"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brumfiel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cardis et al. 2006"/&gt; However, 167 Fukushima plant workers received radiation doses that slightly elevate their risk of developing cancer.&lt;ref name="Brumfiel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unis.unvienna.org"/&gt; Estimated effective doses from the accident outside of Japan are considered to be below, or far below the dose levels regarded as very small by the international radiological protection community.&lt;ref name="who42"/&gt; The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation is expected to release a final report on the effects of radiation exposure from the accident by the end of 2013.&lt;ref name="unis.unvienna.org"/&gt;

A June 2012 Stanford University study estimated, using a [[linear no-threshold model]], that the radioactivity release from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant could cause 130 deaths from cancer globally (the lower bound for the estimate being 15 and the upper bound 1100) and 199 cancer cases in total (the lower bound being 24 and the upper bound 1800), most of which are estimated to occur in Japan. Radiation exposure to workers at the plant was projected to result in 2 to 12 deaths.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt; However, a December 2012 UNSCEAR statement to the Fukushima Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety advised that "because of the great uncertainties in risk estimates at very low doses, UNSCEAR does not recommend multiplying very low doses by large numbers of individuals to estimate numbers of radiation-induced health effects within a population exposed to incremental doses at levels equivalent to or lower than natural background levels."&lt;ref name="UNSCEAR statement"/&gt;

==Health effects==

Preliminary dose-estimation reports by the [[World Health Organization]] and [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] indicate that 167 plant workers received radiation doses that slightly elevate their risk of developing cancer, however like the Chernobyl nuclear disaster that it may not be statistically detectable.&lt;ref name="Cardis et al. 2006" /&gt; After the Chernobyl accident, only 0.1% of the 110,000 cleanup workers surveyed have so far developed leukemia, although not all cases resulted from the accident&lt;ref name="Brumfiel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unis.unvienna.org"/&gt; Estimated effective doses from the accident outside Japan are considered to be below (or far below) the dose levels regarded as very small by the international radiological protection community.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

According to the Japanese Government, 180,592 people in the general population were screened in March 2011 for radiation exposure and no case was found which affects health.&lt;ref name="Seismic Damage Information (the 127th Release)"/&gt; Thirty workers conducting operations at the plant had exposure levels greater than 100 mSv.&lt;ref name="Seismic Damage Information (the 110th Release)"/&gt; It is believed that the health effects of the radioactivity release are primarily psychological rather than physical effects. Even in the most severely affected areas, radiation doses never reached more than a quarter of the radiation dose linked to an increase in cancer risk (25 mSv whereas 100 mSv has been linked to an increase in cancer rates among victims at Hiroshima and Nagasaki).&lt;ref name="Fukushima: Fallout of fear"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/radiation/health-effects/rad-exposure-cancer.html |title=Radiation Exposure and Cancer |date=29 March 2012 |website=[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, people who have been evacuated have suffered from depression and other mental health effects.&lt;ref name="Fukushima: Fallout of fear"/&gt;

While there were no deaths caused by radiation exposure, approximately 18,500 people died due to the earthquake and tsunami. Very few cancers would be expected as a result of the very low radiation doses received by the public.&lt;ref name="NatureBrumfiel"/&gt; John Ten Hoeve and [[Stanford University]] professor [[Mark Z. Jacobson]] suggest that according to the [[linear no-threshold model]] (LNT) the accident is most likely to cause an eventual total of 130 (15-1100) cancer deaths, while noting that the validity of the LNT model at such low doses remains the subject of debate.&lt;ref name="Worldwide health effects of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident"/&gt; [[Radiation epidemiologist]] Roy Shore contends that estimating health effects in a population from the LNT model "is not wise because of the uncertainties".&lt;ref name="Science 2011"/&gt; The LNT model did not accurately model casualties from Chernobyl, Hiroshima or Nagasaki; it greatly overestimated the casualties. Evidence that the LNT model is a gross distortion of damage from radiation has existed since 1946, and was suppressed by Nobel Prize winner [[Paul Hermann Müller|Hermann Muller]] in favour of assertions that no amount of radiation is safe.&lt;ref name="UMass researcher points to suppression of evidence on radiation effects by 1946 Nobel Laureate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Muller's Nobel lecture on dose–response for ionizing radiation: Ideology or science?"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ClinicalOncologyChildren"/&gt;

In 2013 (two years after the incident), the [[World Health Organization]] indicated that the residents of the area who were evacuated were exposed to little radiation that radiation induced health impacts are likely to be below detectable levels.{{sfn|WHO|2013|p=92}} The health risks in the WHO assessment attributable to the Fukushima radioactivity release were calculated by largely applying the conservative [[Linear no-threshold]] model of radiation exposure, a model that assumes even the smallest amount of radiation exposure will cause a negative health effect.{{sfn|WHO|2013|p=83}}

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) report released in 2013 predicts that for populations living around the Fukushima nuclear power plant there is a 70% higher relative risk of developing thyroid cancer for females exposed as infants, and a 7% higher relative risk of leukemia in males exposed as infants and a 6% higher relative risk of breast cancer in females exposed as infants.&lt;ref name="Walsh 2013"/&gt; With the WHO communicating that the values stated in that section of their report are relative increases, and not representative of the absolute increase of developing these cancers, as the lifetime absolute baseline chance of developing thyroid cancer in females is 0.75%, with the [[Radiation-induced cancer]] chance now predicted to increase that 0.75% to 1.25%, with this 0.75% to 1.25% change being responsible for the "70% higher relative risk":&lt;ref name="Walsh 2013"/&gt;{{Quote|These percentages represent estimated relative increases over the baseline rates and are not absolute risks for developing such cancers. Due to the low baseline rates of thyroid cancer, even a large relative increase represents a small absolute increase in risks. For example, the baseline lifetime risk of thyroid cancer for females is just (0.75%)three-quarters of one percent and the additional lifetime risk estimated in this assessment for a female infant exposed in the most affected location is (0.5%)one-half of one percent.}}

The [[WHO]] calculations determined that the most at-risk group, [[infant]]s, who were in the most affected area, would experience an absolute increase in the risk of [[cancer]] (of all types) during their lifetime, of approximately 1% due to the accident. With the lifetime risk increase for [[thyroid cancer]], due to the accident, for a female infant, in the most affected radiation location, being estimated to be one half of one percent[0.5%].&lt;ref name="Walsh 2013"/&gt;{{sfn|WHO|2013|pp=8–9}} Cancer risks for the [[in utero|unborn child]] are considered to be similar to those in 1 year old infants.{{sfn|WHO|2013|pp=70, 79–80}}

The estimated risk of cancer to people who were children and adults during the Fukushima accident, in the most affected area, was determined to be lower again when compared to the most at-risk group—[[infant]]s.{{sfn|WHO|2013|p=13}} A thyroid ultrasound screening programme is currently (2013) ongoing in the entire Fukushima prefecture; this screening programme is, due to the [[Screening (medicine)|screening effect]], likely to lead to an increase in the incidence of thyroid disease due to early detection of non-[[symptomatic]] disease cases.{{sfn|WHO|2013|pp=87–8}}
About one-third of people (~30%) in industrialized nations are presently diagnosed with cancer during their lifetimes. Radiation exposure can increase cancer risk, with the cancers that arise being indistinguishable from cancers resulting from other causes.{{sfn|WHO|2013|p=19}}

In the general population, no increase is expected in the frequency of
tissue reactions attributable to radiation exposure and no increase is expected in the incidence of [[congenital]] or developmental abnormalities, including cognitive impairment attributable to in-utero radiation exposure.{{sfn|WHO|2013|p=67}} No significant increase in heritable effects has been found in studies of the children of the survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki or in the offspring of cancer survivors treated with radiotherapy, which indicates that moderate acute radiation exposures have little impact
on the overall risk of heritable effects in humans.{{sfn|WHO|2013|p=24}}

As of August 2013, there have been more than 40 children newly diagnosed with [[thyroid cancer]] and other cancers in [[Fukushima prefecture]]. 18 of these were diagnosed with thyroid cancer, but these cancers are not attributed to radiation from Fukushima, as similar patterns occurred before the accident in 2006 in Japan, with 1 in 100,000 children per year developing thyroid cancer in that year, that is, this is not higher than the pre-accident rate. While controversial scientist [[Christopher Busby]] disagrees, claiming the rate of thyroid cancer in Japan was 0.0 children per 100,000 in 2005, the Japan Cancer Surveillance Research Group showed a thyroid cancer rate of 1.3 per 100,000 children in 2005 based on official cancer cases.&lt;ref name=ClinicalOncologyChildren /&gt; As a point of comparison, thyroid cancer incidence rates after the Chernobyl accident of 1986 did not begin to increase above the prior baseline value of about 0.7 cases per 100,000 people per year until 1989 to 1991, 3 to 5 years after the accident in both the adolescent and children age groups. Therefore, data from Chernobyl suggests that an increase in thyroid cancer around Fukushima is not expected to begin to be seen until at least 3 to 5 years after the accident&lt;ref name="rt.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hormones.gr"/&gt;

According to the Tenth Report of the Fukushima Prefecture Health Management Survey released in February 2013, more than 40% of children screened around Fukushima prefecture were diagnosed with thyroid nodules or cysts. Ultrasonographic detectable thyroid nodules and cysts are extremely common and can be found at a frequency of up to 67% in various studies.&lt;ref name="Very high prevalence of thyroid nodules detected by high frequency (13 MHz) ultrasound examination."&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19601965 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2362.2009.02162.x | volume=39 | issue=8 | title=Very high prevalence of thyroid nodules detected by high frequency (13 MHz) ultrasound examination | year=2009 | journal=Eur.

None had thyroid cancer. An [[RT (TV network)|RT]] report into the matter was highly misleading.&lt;ref name="Russia Times"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rt.com/news/fukushima-children-thyroids-abnormalities-cancer-444/ | work=Russia Times | title=Fukushima kids have skyrocketing number of thyroid abnormalities - report | date=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fukushima Medical University gives the number of children diagnosed with thyroid cancer as of December 2013 as 33 and concluded, "[I]t is unlikely that these cancers were caused by the exposure from &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I from the nuclear power plant accident in March 2011".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fmu.ac.jp/radiationhealth/workshop201402/presentation/Co-Chairs_Summary_E.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209225613/http://www.fmu.ac.jp/radiationhealth/workshop201402/presentation/Co-Chairs_Summary_E.pdf |archivedate=9 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Thyroid cancer]] is one of the most survivable cancers, with an approximate [[List of cancer mortality rates in the United States|94% survival rate]] after first diagnosis. That rate increases to a 100% survival rate with catching it early.&lt;ref name="acc"/&gt;

A 2013 article in the [[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]] asserted that a Japanese government study{{which|date=September 2013}} released in February of that year had found that more than 25 times as many people in the area had developed thyroid cancer compared with data from before the disaster.&lt;ref name="In growing lawsuit, servicemembers fault TEPCO for radiation-related illnesses"/&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=September 2013}}

As part of the ongoing precautionary ultrasound [[screening (medicine)|screening]] program in and around Fukushima, (36%) of children in [[Fukushima Prefecture]] in 2012 were found to have thyroid nodules or cysts,&lt;ref name="Fukushima Health Study"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fmu.ac.jp/radiationhealth/conference/presentation/day1/1109.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813220512/http://www.fmu.ac.jp/radiationhealth/conference/presentation/day1/1109.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 August 2013 |title=Highly Sophisticated Thyroid Ultrasound Examination used in the Fukushima Health management Survey |author=Fukushima Medical University |date=25 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but these are not considered abnormal.&lt;ref name="Ryall" /&gt; This screening programme is, due to the [[Screening (medicine)|screening effect]], likely, according to the [[WHO]], to lead to an increase in the incidence of the diagnosis of thyroid disease due to early detection of non-[[symptomatic]] disease cases.{{sfn|WHO|2013|pp=87–8}} For example, the overwhelming majority of thyroid growths prior to the accident, and in other parts of the world, are [[overdiagnosed]] (that is, a benign growth that will never cause any symptoms, illness, or death for the patient, even if nothing is ever done about the growth) with [[autopsy]] studies, again done prior to the accident and in other parts of the world, on people who died from other causes showing that more than one third (33%+), of adults technically has a thyroid growth/cancer, but it is benign/never caused them any harm.&lt;ref name="Welch"/&gt;

[[Thyroid cancer]] is one of the most survivable cancers, with an approximate [[List of cancer mortality rates in the United States|94% survival rate]] after first diagnosis, and that rate increases to a 100% survival rate with catching it early.&lt;ref name="acc"/&gt; For example, from 1989 to 2005, an excess of 4000 children and adolescent cases of thyroid cancer were observed in those who lived around Chernobyl; of these 4000 people, nine have died so far, a 99% survival rate.&lt;ref name="Chernobyl: the true scale of the accident. 20 Years Later a UN Report Provides Definitive Answers and Ways to Repair Lives"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brasor, Philip, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/10/31/national/media-national/cancer-fukushima-trust/ Cancer and Fukushima: Who to trust?]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 1 November 2015, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological effects of perceived radiation exposure===
A survey by the newspaper Mainichi Shimbun computed that there were 1,600 deaths related to the evacuation, comparable to the 1,599 deaths due to the earthquake and tsunami in the Fukushima Prefecture.&lt;ref name="Fukushima evacuation has killed more than earthquake and tsunami, survey says"/&gt;

In the former [[Soviet Union]], many patients with negligible radioactive exposure after the [[Chernobyl disaster]] displayed extreme anxiety about low level radiation exposure, and therefore developed many [[psychosomatic]] problems, including [[radiophobia]], and with this an increase in [[fatalism|fatalistic]] [[alcoholism]] being observed. As Japanese health and radiation specialist [[Shunichi Yamashita]] noted: {{Quote|We know from Chernobyl that the [[psychological]] consequences are enormous. Life expectancy of the evacuees dropped from 65 to 58 years—not [predominantly] because of cancer, but because of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], alcoholism and [[suicide]]. Relocation is not easy, the [[stress (psychological)|stress]] is very big. We must not only track those problems, but also treat them. Otherwise people will feel they are just guinea pigs in our research.&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt;}}

Findings from the Chernobyl disaster indicated the need for rigorous resource allocation, and research findings from Chernobyl were utilized in the Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster response. A survey by the [[Iitate, Fukushima]] local government obtained responses from approximately 1,743 people who have evacuated from the village, which lies within the emergency evacuation zone around the crippled Fukushima Daiichi Plant. It shows that many residents are experiencing growing frustration and instability due to the nuclear crisis and an inability to return to the lives they were living before the disaster. Sixty percent of respondents stated that their health and the health of their families had deteriorated after evacuating, while 39.9% reported feeling more irritated compared to before the disaster.&lt;ref name="main2012"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Summarizing all responses to questions related to evacuees' current family status, one-third of all surveyed families live apart from their children, while 50.1% live away from other family members (including elderly parents) with whom they lived before the disaster. The survey also showed that 34.7% of the evacuees have suffered salary cuts of 50% or more since the outbreak of the nuclear disaster. A total of 36.8% reported a lack of sleep, while 17.9% reported smoking or drinking more than before they evacuated.&lt;ref name=main2012/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Experts on the ground in Japan agree that mental health challenges are the most significant issue. Stress, such as that caused by dislocation, uncertainty, and concern about unseen toxicants, often manifests in physical ailments, such as heart disease. After a nuclear power plant disaster, residents of the affected areas are at a higher risk for mental health illnesses such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), medically unexplained somatic symptoms, and suicide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Bromet, E. (2014, February). Emotional Consequences of Nuclear Power Plant Disasters. ''Health Physics, 106''(2), 206-210. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1097/HP.0000000000000012&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These mental health illnesses, among others, have been highly prevalent in the Fukushima residents following the nuclear power plant disaster.

Stressors that were identified as risk factors for these negative mental outcomes include: length of duration of evacuation, house damage, separation from family members, inability to family members and friends after the disaster, watching the earthquake on television, life-threatening experience during the quake and tsunamis, injury, plant explosion, unemployment among middle-aged men, burying loved ones themselves, lack of social support, pre-existing health problems, misunderstanding of radiation exposure risk, lack of clarity regarding benefits, on-going stigma regarding radiation, distrust of government, distrust of public health authorities, distrust of the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) management, burnout among mental health workers, low income, loss of colleagues, and intra-family conflict.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Ando, S., Kuwabara, H., Araki, T., Kanehara, A., Tanaka, S., Morishima, R., K., . . .

At-risk populations were identified through the implementation of surveys such as the Fukushima Health Management Survey (FHMS). The FHMS began soon after the Fukushima disaster and has tracked health outcomes for several years after the event.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The intent and goals of the FHMS surveys was to “monitor the long-term health of residents, promote their future well-being, and confirm whether long-term low-dose radiation exposure has health effects.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Yasumura, S., Hosoya, M., Yamashita, S., Kamiya, K., Abe, M.,Akashi, M., . . . Ozasa, K. (2012). Study Protocol for the Fukushima Health Management Survey. ''Tokyo Japan Journal of Epidemiology, 22''(5), 375-383. doi:10.2188/jea.JE20120105&lt;/ref&gt; The FHMS is a general survey that includes four detailed surveys (thyroid ultrasound exam, comprehensive health check, mental health and lifestyle survey, and pregnancy and birth survey).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These surveys, which were given to both children and adults, addressed mental status, physical status, 6-month activities, perception of radiation risk, and experiences during and after disaster.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The FHMS surveys are ongoing and are reported out on an annual basis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to the FHMS survey, the top three mental health diagnoses (discussed further below) include:

-Depression

-Anxiety

-Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

'''Depression'''

The disaster affected all ages of the population, and though adolescents were more likely to develop mental health problems in general, older adults were more likely to develop depression.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For evacuees living in temporary housing, depression was more often long-term for these individuals when compared to the general population in Fukushima.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Rates of depression were high among mothers who lived in Fukushima and were pregnant when the disaster occurred, and remained high in the months after the baby was born.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Depressive symptoms occurred even more so in women who experienced interruption in obstetrical care because of the nuclear disaster and potentially from damaged healthcare buildings.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; About a quarter of the women who were pregnant at the time of the disaster experienced symptoms of depression, and though the proportion of concerned expectant mothers decreased over time, counselling services were still provided in the years following due to the number of women concerned about the potential health effects from the event.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Also, one study looking at elderly individuals from Iwanuma City in the Miyagi prefecture found that exercise may help decrease depressive symptoms among older adults who survived the earthquake and tsunami disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Tsuji, T., Sasaki, Y., Matsuyama, Y., Sato, Y., Aida, J., Kondo, K., &amp; Kawachi, I. (2017). Reducing depressive symptoms after the Great East Japan Earthquake in older survivors through group exercise participation and regular walking: a prospective study. ''BMJ Open, 7'', e013706. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013706&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anxiety'''

One of the most common fears regarding nuclear disasters is radiation exposure. Parental anxiety was one of the reasons for thyroid ultrasound examinations in children after the disaster.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 2015, one study found that in a group of 300,473 children that had undergone a thyroid ultrasound since the Fukushima nuclear disaster, nearly half of this sample had developed nodules or cysts; 116 children from this sample developed nodules that were malignant or otherwise suspicious.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Measures were taken to decrease the amount of radiation exposure due to side effects expected to potentially occur with exposure. For example, restrictions were placed on certain food from the region and internationally; Japanese goods were placed under restrictions by some countries initially after the disaster.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Tough restrictions were left in place because the public generally did not have a clear idea of the risks from radiation exposure, and implementing policy changes to reflect less restrictive, but low-risk, levels of radiation received push-back in Japan.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

Furthermore, those in the evacuation zone had to wait to return home, and some residents were unable to return home until several years after the event when living restrictions were finally lifted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, lifting the living restrictions did not always help residents as most were uneasy about returning home due to fears of health hazards as well as the stability of the communities if they were to return home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
 
Low doses of radiation may not contribute much to create health effects like cancer, and given that such low doses may never lead to disease for most individuals, this raises the question of how evacuation should be handled in a situation like that of Fukushima.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Ethical considerations need to be taken regarding the impact on mental health versus the costs of allowing low amounts of exposure.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The many ways in which nuclear radiation could affect people in the area, whether through real health consequences or fear, are cause for anxiety; however, it appears that these fears may be settling in the Fukushima population as symptoms of anxiety have become less prevalent over time since the disaster.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

'''PTSD'''

At least 10% of participants in studies following the Fukushima disaster developed PTSD.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Among power plant workers from the event, it is possible that risk for post-traumatic stress disorder increased with age as younger workers tended not to develop this response as often as older workers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; After the nuclear disaster, stigmatization and discrimination were issues in general for nuclear power plant workers in the region whether they worked at the Daiichi plant or another plant that was not part of the nuclear disaster.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Greater amounts of discrimination and stressors in the first two to three months after the disaster were associated with general psychological distress and PTSD symptoms a year later, according to one study that assessed the mental health impact of slurs and discrimination on power plant workers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Like other mental health problems, the need for support for PTSD symptoms decreased over time; one study found that the percentage of Fukushima Prefecture adult participants needing support was 15.8% in 2013, a nearly 6% decrease compared to what was observed in 2011 after the disaster.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For all mental health needs, support services were provided soon after the disaster and in years following in order to help individuals suffering from symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD; and it appears these services may have been worthwhile as symptoms of these mental health issues decreased in prevalence over time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It should be noted that depression, anxiety, and PTSD were not the only notable mental health concerns that came out of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Other mental health issues that came out of the event include increased suicide risk.

'''Suicide'''

One of the most severe long-term effects the survey found is an increase in rates of suicide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the first few years after the disaster, suicide rates decreased, but after 2013, there was a significant increase in the rate of suicide that surpassed the rate of suicide in the year before the disaster.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The rate of suicide also increased more rapidly in Fukushima at this time than in surrounding prefectures that were affected by the earthquake and tsunami.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There has been suggestion that support services may have helped cause the decrease in rate of suicide for the first few years after the disaster, and the relapse in 2014 may indicate further need for these resources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Overall, the FHMS survey and other research assisted with identifying the barriers to adequate mental health care.

The barriers identified to improving the mental health outcomes of Fukushima residents include: delays and miscommunication of benefits, a decline of health professionals assisting due to “burn out,” rumors and public stigma of radiation, cultural stigma in Japan against mental health disorders (causing affected individuals to be less likely to seek assistance), distrust in authorities (i.e. government and healthcare professionals), and tension with the community health workers due to differences in perceptions of radiation risk.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Based on these barriers, researchers were able to make recommendations for prevention and treatment of such mental health outcomes. 

In order to effectively assist Fukushima residents and reduce the negative mental health outcomes, there needs to be further research to adequately identify the risk factors for mental health disorders. By doing so, efficient programs may be implemented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Programs (including mental health screenings), treatments, and resource distribution should be focused on high-risk groups immediately after the disaster, such as mothers and infants and nuclear power plant workers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Strategies that aim to reduce the incidence of the negative cultural stigma on mental health disorders in Japan should be implemented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, researchers and policymakers should continue to monitor for long-term mental effects as they may not be present right away.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 



==Total emissions==

On 24 May 2012, more than a year after the disaster, TEPCO released their estimate of radioactivity releases due to the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster. An estimated 538.1 [[Becquerel|petabecquerels]] (PBq) of [[iodine-131]], [[caesium-134]] and [[caesium-137]] was released. 520 PBq was released into the atmosphere between 12 and 31 March 2011 and 18.1 PBq into the ocean from 26 March to 30 September 2011. A total of 511 PBq of iodine-131 was released into both the atmosphere and the ocean, 13.5 PBq of caesium-134 and 13.6 PBq of caesium-137.&lt;ref name="The Estimated Amount of Radioactive Materials Released into the Air and the Ocean Caused by Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station Accident Due to the Tohoku-Chihou-Taiheiyou-Oki Earthquake (As of May 2012)"/&gt; In May 2012, TEPCO reported that at least 900 PBq had been released "into the atmosphere in March last year [2011] alone"&lt;ref name="TEPCO puts radiation release early in Fukushima crisis at 900 PBq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fukushima radiation higher than first estimated"/&gt; up from previous estimates of 360-370 PBq total.

The primary releases of radioactive nuclides have been iodine and caesium;&lt;ref name="newscientist1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Radioactive emissions from Japan plant approach Chernobyl levels"/&gt; strontium&lt;ref name="NHKStrontium" /&gt; and plutonium&lt;ref name="edition.cnn.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="High concentrations of plutonium from the soil of rice field 50&amp;nbsp;km or more distant primary"/&gt; have also been found. These elements have been released into the air via steam;&lt;ref name="Radioactive steam released from nuclear plants"/&gt; and into the water leaking into groundwater&lt;ref name="Groundwater radiation level at nuke plant rises: TEPCO"/&gt; or the ocean.&lt;ref name="Japan nuclear update: Repairing crack to stop radioactive water leak"/&gt; The expert who prepared a frequently cited Austrian Meteorological Service report asserted that the "Chernobyl accident emitted much more radioactivity and a wider diversity of radioactive elements than Fukushima Daiichi has so far, but it was iodine and caesium that caused most of the health risk – especially outside the immediate area of the Chernobyl plant."&lt;ref name="newscientist1"/&gt; Iodine-131 has a half-life of 8&amp;nbsp;days while caesium-137 has a half-life of over 30 years. The IAEA has developed a method that weighs the "radiological equivalence" for different elements.&lt;ref name="INES – The International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale pg. 16"/&gt; TEPCO has published estimates using a simple-sum methodology,&lt;ref name="tepco.co.jp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nisa.meti.go.jp" /&gt; {{As of|2012|4|25}} TEPCO has not released a total water and air release estimate.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

According to a June 2011 report of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), at that time no confirmed long-term health effects to any person had been reported as a result of radiation exposure from the nuclear accident.&lt;ref name="IAEAJune"/&gt;

According to one expert, the release of radioactivity is about one-tenth that from the [[Chernobyl disaster]] and the contaminated area is also about one-tenth that of Chernobyl.&lt;ref name="Frank N. von Hippel 27–36"/&gt;

===Air releases===
A 12 April report prepared by NISA estimated the total release of iodine-131 was 130&amp;nbsp;[[Becquerel|PBq]] and caesium-137 at 6.1&amp;nbsp;[[Becquerel|PBq]].&lt;ref name="nisa.meti.go.jp"/&gt; On 23 April the NSC updated its release estimates, but it did not reestimate the total release, instead indicating that 154&amp;nbsp;TBq of air release were occurring daily as of 5 April.&lt;ref name="translate.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yomiuri.co.jp"/&gt;

On 24 August 2011, the Nuclear Safety Commission (NSC) of Japan published the results of the recalculation of the total amount of radioactive materials released into the air during the incident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. The total amounts released between 11 March and 5 April were revised downwards to 130&amp;nbsp;PBq for iodine-131 (I-131) and 11&amp;nbsp;PBq for caesium-137 (Cs-137). Earlier estimations were 150&amp;nbsp;PBq and 12&amp;nbsp;PBq.&lt;ref name="jaif"/&gt;

On 20 September the Japanese government and TEPCO announced the installation of new filters at reactors 1, 2 and 3 to reduce the release of radioactive materials into the air. Gases from the reactors would be decontaminated before they would be released into the air. In the first half of September 2011 the amount of radioactive substances released from the plant was about 200 million becquerels per hour, according to TEPCO, which was approximately one-four millionths of the level of the initial stages of the accident in March.&lt;ref name="jaif1"/&gt;

According to TEPCO the emissions immediately after the accident were around 220 billion becquerel; readings declined after that, and in November and December 2011 they dropped to 17 thousand becquerel, about one-13 millionth the initial level. But in January 2012 due to human activities at the plant, the emissions rose again up to 19 thousand becquerel. Radioactive materials around reactor 2, where the surroundings were still highly contaminated, got stirred up by the workers going in and out of the building, when they inserted an optical endoscope into the containment vessel as a first step toward decommissioning the reactor.&lt;ref name="nhk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jaif2"/&gt;

====Iodine-131====
A widely cited [[Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics|Austrian Meteorological Service]] report estimated the total amount of I-131 released into the air as of 19 March based on extrapolating data from several days of ideal observation at some of its worldwide [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization|CTBTO]] radionuclide measuring facilities (Freiburg, Germany; Stockholm, Sweden; Takasaki, Japan and Sacramento, USA) during the first 10&amp;nbsp;days of the accident.&lt;ref name="newscientist1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated17"/&gt; The report's estimates of total I-131 emissions based on these worldwide measuring stations ranged from 10&amp;nbsp;PBq to 700&amp;nbsp;PBq.&lt;ref name="autogenerated17"/&gt; This estimate was 1% to 40% of the 1760&amp;nbsp;PBq&lt;ref name="autogenerated17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated18"/&gt; of the I-131 estimated to have been released at Chernobyl.&lt;ref name="newscientist1"/&gt;

A later, 12 April 2011, [[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency|NISA]] and [[Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission|NSC]] report estimated the total air release of [[iodine-131]] at 130&amp;nbsp;PBq and 150&amp;nbsp;PBq, respectively – about 30&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref name="nisa.meti.go.jp"/&gt; However, on 23 April, the NSC revised its original estimates of iodine-131 released.&lt;ref name="translate.google.com"/&gt; The NSC did not estimate the total release size based upon these updated numbers, but estimated a release of 0.14&amp;nbsp;TBq per hour (0.00014 PBq/hr) on 5 April.&lt;ref name="translate.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yomiuri.co.jp"/&gt;

On 22 September the results were published of a survey conducted by the Japanese Science Ministry. This survey showed that radioactive iodine was spread northwest and south of the plant. Soil samples were taken at 2,200 locations, mostly in Fukushima Prefecture, in June and July, and with this a map was created of the radioactive contamination as of 14 June. Because of the short half-life of 8&amp;nbsp;days only 400&amp;nbsp;locations were still positive. This map showed that iodine-131 spread northwest of the plant, just like caesium-137 as indicated on an earlier map. But I-131 was also found south of the plant at relatively high levels, even higher than those of caesium-137 in coastal areas south of the plant. According to the ministry, clouds moving southwards apparently caught large amounts of iodine-131 that were emitted at the time. The survey was done to determine the risks for thyroid cancer within the population.&lt;ref name="jaif3"/&gt;

====Tellurium-129m====
On 31 October the Japanese ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology released a map showing the contamination of radioactive tellurium-129m within a 100-kilometer radius around the Fukushima No.&amp;nbsp;1 nuclear plant. The map displayed the concentrations found of tellurium-129m – a byproduct of uranium fission – in the soil at 14 June 2011. High concentrations were discovered northwest of the plant and also at 28&amp;nbsp;kilometers south near the coast, in the cities of Iwaki, Fukushima Prefecture, and Kitaibaraki, Ibaraki Prefecture. Iodine-131 was also found in the same areas, and most likely the tellurium was deposited at the same time as the iodine. The highest concentration found was 2.66&amp;nbsp;million becquerels per square meter, two kilometers from the plant in the empty town of Okuma. Tellurium-129m has a half-life of 6&amp;nbsp;days, so present levels are a very small fraction of the initial contamination. Tellurium has no biological functions, so even when drinks or food were contaminated with it, it would not accumulate in the body, like iodine in the thyroid gland.&lt;ref name="mainichi"/&gt;

====Caesium-137====
On 24 March 2011, the [[Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics|Austrian Meteorological Service]] report estimated the total amount of caesium-137 released into the air as of 19 March based on extrapolating data from several days of ideal observation at a handful of worldwide [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization|CTBTO]] radionuclide measuring facilities. The agency estimated an average being 5&amp;nbsp;PBq daily.&lt;ref name="newscientist1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated17"/&gt; Over the course of the disaster, Chernobyl put out a total of 85&amp;nbsp;PBq of caesium-137.&lt;ref name="newscientist1" /&gt; However, later reporting on 12 April estimated total caesium releases at 6.1&amp;nbsp;PBq to 12&amp;nbsp;PBq, respectively by NISA and NSC – about 2–4&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="nisa.meti.go.jp"/&gt; On 23 April, NSC updated this number to 0.14&amp;nbsp;TBq per hour of caesium-137 on 5 April, but did not recalculate the entire release estimate.&lt;ref name="translate.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yomiuri.co.jp"/&gt;

====Strontium 90====
On 12 October 2011 a concentration of 195 becquerels/kilogram of [[Strontium-90]] was found in the sediment on the roof of an apartment building in the city of [[Yokohama]], south of Tokyo, some 250&amp;nbsp;km from the plant in Fukushima. This first find of strontium above 100&amp;nbsp;becquerels per kilogram raised serious concerns that leaked radioactivity might have spread far further than the Japanese government expected. The find was done by a private agency that conducted the test upon the request of a resident. After this find Yokohama city started an investigation of soil samples collected from areas near the building. The science ministry said that the source of the Strontium was still unclear.&lt;ref name="mainichi4"/&gt;

====Plutonium isotopes====
On 30 September 2011, the Japanese Ministry of Education and Science published the results of a plutonium fallout survey, for which in June and July 50 soil samples were collected from a radius of slightly more than 80&amp;nbsp;km around the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Plutonium was found in all samples, which is to be expected since plutonium from the nuclear weapon tests of the 1950s and '60s is found everywhere on the planet. The highest levels found (of Pu-239 and Pu-240 combined) were 15&amp;nbsp;becquerels per square meters in Fukushima prefecture and 9.4&amp;nbsp;Bq in Ibaraki prefecture, compared to a global average of 0.4 to 3.7 Bq/kg from atomic bomb tests. Earlier in June, university researchers detected smaller amounts of plutonium in soil outside the plant after they collected samples during filming by NHK.&lt;ref name="jaif5"/&gt;

A recent study published in Nature found up to 35 bq/kg plutonium 241 in leaf litter in 3 out of 19 sites in the most contaminated zone in Fukushima. They estimated the Pu-241 dose for a person living for 50 years in the vicinity of the most contaminated site to be 0.44 mSv. However, the Cs-137 activity at the sites where Pu-241 was found was very high (up to 4.7 MBq/kg or about 135,000 times greater than the plutonium 241 activity), which suggests that it will be the Cs-137 which prevents habitation rather than the relatively small amounts of plutonium of any isotope in these areas.&lt;ref name="Isotopic evidence of plutonium release into the environment from the Fukushima DNPP accident"/&gt;

===Water releases===
On 21 April, TEPCO estimated that 520 tons of radioactive water leaked into the sea before leaks in a pit in unit&amp;nbsp;2 were plugged, totaling 4.7&amp;nbsp;PBq of water release (calculated by simple sum, which is inconsistent with the IAEA methodology for mixed-nuclide releases&lt;ref name="tepco.co.jp"/&gt;) (20,000 times facility's annual limit).&lt;ref name="tepco.co.jp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NHK520t"/&gt; TEPCO's detailed estimates were 2.8&amp;nbsp;PBq of I-131, 0.94&amp;nbsp;PBq of Cs-134, 0.940&amp;nbsp;PBq of Cs-137.&lt;ref name="tepco.co.jp"/&gt;

Another 300,000 tons of relatively less-radioactive water had already been reported to have leaked or been purposefully pumped into the sea to free room for storage of highly radioactively contaminated water.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; TEPCO had attempted to contain contaminated water in the harbor near the plant by installing "curtains" to prevent outflow, but now believes this effort was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

According to a report published in October 2011 by the [[Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire|French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety]], between 21 March and mid-July around 2.7&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Bq of caesium-137 (about 8.4&amp;nbsp;kg) entered the ocean, about 82&amp;nbsp;percent having flowed into the sea before 8 April.&lt;ref name="IRSN-Oct-2011"/&gt; This emission of radioactivity into the sea represents the most important individual emission of artificial radioactivity into the sea ever observed. However, the Fukushima coast has some of the world's strongest currents and these transported the contaminated waters far into the Pacific Ocean, thus causing great dispersion of the radioactive elements. The results of measurements of both the seawater and the coastal sediments led to the supposition that the consequences of the accident, in terms of radioactivity, would be minor for marine life as of autumn 2011 (weak concentration of radioactivity in the water and limited accumulation in sediments). On the other hand, significant pollution of sea water along the coast near the nuclear plant might persist, because of the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported towards the sea by surface water running over contaminated soil. Further, some coastal areas might have less-favorable dilution or sedimentation characteristics than those observed so far. Finally, the possible presence of other persistent radioactive substances, such as strontium-90 or plutonium, has not been sufficiently studied. Recent{{when|date=April 2016}} measurements show persistent contamination of some marine species (mostly fish) caught along the coast of Fukushima district. Organisms that filter water and fish at the top of the food chain are, over time, the most sensitive to caesium pollution. It is thus justified to maintain surveillance of marine life that is fished in the coastal waters off Fukushima. Despite caesium isotopic concentration in the waters off of Japan being 10 to 1000 times above concentration prior to the accident, radiation risks are below what is generally considered harmful to marine animals and human consumers.&lt;ref name="Fukushima-derived radionuclides in the ocean and biota off Japan"/&gt;

A year after the disaster, in April 2012, sea fish caught near the Fukushima power plant still contain as much radioactive &lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs and &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs compared to fish caught in the days after the disaster.&lt;ref name="Buesseler2012"/&gt; At the end of October 2012 TEPCO admitted that it could not exclude radioactivity releases into the ocean, although the radiation levels were stabilised. Undetected leaks into the ocean from the reactors, could not be ruled out, because their basements remain flooded with cooling water, and the 2,400-foot-long steel and concrete wall between the site’s reactors and the ocean, that should reach 100&amp;nbsp;feet underground, was still under construction, and would not be finished before mid-2014. Around August 2012 two greenling were caught close to the Fukushima shore, they contained more than 25 kBq per kilogram of caesium, the highest caesium levels found in fish since the disaster and 250 times the government’s safety limit.&lt;ref name="Fish Off Japan's Coast Said to Contain Elevated Levels of Cesium"/&gt;

In August 2013, a Nuclear Regulatory Authority task force reported that contaminated groundwater had breached an underground barrier, was rising toward the surface and exceeded legal limits of radioactive discharge.&lt;ref name=Reuters20130806/&gt; The underground barrier was only effective in solidifying the ground at least 1.8&amp;nbsp;meters below the surface, and water began seeping through shallow areas of earth into the sea.&lt;ref name="Reuters20130806"/&gt;

==Radiation at the plant site==
[[File:FukushimaI rad long term prequake.PNG|thumb|Normal radiation dose rates at the Fukushima I site as established by the stream of monitoring post readings in the 3 months preceding the accident. (03/01=1 March 2011, 1 [[Gray (unit)|Gray]]= 1 Sv for gamma radiation)&lt;ref name="monitoring data"/&gt;]]
Radiation fluctuated widely on the site after the tsunami and often correlated to fires and explosions on site. Radiation dose rates at one location between reactor units 3 and 4 was measured at 400&amp;nbsp;[[sievert|mSv/h]] at 10:22 JST, 13 March, causing experts to urge rapid rotation of emergency crews as a method of limiting exposure to radiation.&lt;ref name="Aus2"/&gt; Dose rates of 1,000&amp;nbsp;mSv/h were reported (but not confirmed by the IAEA)&lt;ref name="IAEAiodine"/&gt; close to the certain reactor units on 16 March, prompting a temporary evacuation of plant workers, with radiation levels subsequently dropping back to 800–600&amp;nbsp;mSv/h.&lt;ref name=cbs1 /&gt; At times, radiation monitoring was hampered by a belief that some radiation levels may be higher than 1&amp;nbsp;Sv/h, but that "authorities say 1,000 millisieverts [per hour] is the upper limit of their measuring devices."&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"/&gt;

===Exposure of workers===
Prior to the accident, the maximum permissible dose for Japanese nuclear workers was 100&amp;nbsp;mSv per year, but on 15 March 2011, the Japanese Health and Labor Ministry increased that annual limit to 250&amp;nbsp;mSv, for emergency situations.&lt;ref name="NYT16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gov't ups permissible radiation level"/&gt; This level is below the 500&amp;nbsp;mSv/year considered acceptable for emergency work by the [[World Health Organization]]. Some contract companies working for TEPCO have opted not to use the higher limit.&lt;ref name="archive"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WNN24/&gt; On 15 March, TEPCO decided to work with a skeleton crew (in the media called the [[Fukushima 50]]) in order to minimize the number of people exposed to radiation.&lt;ref name="Asahi"/&gt;

On 17 March, IAEA reported 17 persons to have suffered deposition of radioactive material on their face; the levels of exposure were too low to warrant hospital treatment.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt; On 22 March, World Nuclear News reported that one worker had received over 100&amp;nbsp;mSv during "venting work" at Unit 3.&lt;ref name="WNN22"/&gt; An additional 6 had received over 100&amp;nbsp;mSv, of which for 1 a level of over 150&amp;nbsp;mSv was reported for unspecified activities on site.&lt;ref name=WNN22/&gt; On 24 March, three workers were exposed to high levels of radiation which caused two of them to require hospital treatment after radioactive water seeped through their protective clothes while working in unit 3. Based on the dosimeter values, exposures of 170&amp;nbsp;mSv were estimated,&lt;ref name="WNN24"/&gt; the injuries indicated exposure to 2000 to 6000 mSv around their ankles.&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt;&lt;ref name="2 Japanese nuclear workers hospitalized for radiation exposure"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kyodo81122"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Japan Raises Possibility of Breach in Reactor Vessel"/&gt; They were not wearing protective boots, as their employing firm's safety manuals "did not assume a scenario in which its employees would carry out work standing in water at a nuclear power plant".&lt;ref name="kyodo81122"/&gt; The amount of the radioactivity of the water was about 3.9 [[Mega-|M]] [[Becquerel|Bq]] per cubic centimetre.

As of 24 March 19:30 (JST), 17 workers (of which 14 were from plant operator [[TEPCO]]) had been exposed to levels of over 100&amp;nbsp;mSv.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt; By 29 March, the number of workers reported to have been exposed to levels of over 100&amp;nbsp;mSv had increased to 19.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"/&gt; An American physician reported Japanese doctors have considered banking blood for future treatment of workers exposed to radiation.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"/&gt; Tepco has started a re-assessment of the approximately 8300 workers and emergency personnel who have been involved in responding to the incident, which has revealed that by 13 July, of the approximately 6700 personnel tested so far, 88 personnel have received between 100 and 150 mSv, 14 have received between 150 and 200 mSv, 3 have received between 200 and 250 mSv, and 6 have received above 250 mSv.&lt;ref name="Status of countermeasures for restoring from the accident at Fukushima Daiich Unit 1 through 4. As of July&amp;nbsp;18th,&amp;nbsp;2011"/&gt;

TEPCO has been criticized in its provision of safety equipment for its workers.&lt;ref name="english.kyodonews.jp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"/&gt; After NISA warned TEPCO that workers were sharing [[dosimeter]]s, since most of the devices were lost in the disaster, the utility sent more to the plant.&lt;ref name="JapanTimesApr1"/&gt; Japanese media has reported that workers indicate that standard decontamination procedures are not being observed.&lt;ref name="mainichi6"/&gt; Others reports suggest that contract workers are given more dangerous work than TEPCO employees.&lt;ref name="english.kyodonews.jp"/&gt; TEPCO is also seeking workers willing to risk high radiation levels for short periods of time in exchange for high pay.&lt;ref name="yue"/&gt; Confidential documents acquired by the Japanese Asahi newspaper suggest that TEPCO hid high levels of radioactive contamination from employees in the days following the incident.&lt;ref name="AsahiConcealed"/&gt; In particular, the Asahi reported that radiation levels of 300&amp;nbsp;mSv/h were detected at least twice on 13 March, but that "the workers who were trying to bring the disaster under control at the plant were not informed of the levels."&lt;ref name="AsahiConcealed" /&gt;

Workers on-site now wear full-body radiation protection gear, including masks and helmets covering their entire heads, but it means they have another enemy: heat.&lt;ref name="TEPCO lambasted by health ministry for lax employee management"/&gt; As of 19 July 2011, 33 cases of heat stroke had been recorded.&lt;ref name="Health and Safety Considerations: Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant Workers at Risk of Heat-Related Illness"/&gt; In these harsh working conditions, two workers in their 60s died from heart failure.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fourth worker at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant dies"/&gt;

====Iodine-intake====
On 19 July 2013 TEPCO said that 1,973 employees would have a thyroid-radiation dose exceeding 100 millisieverts. 19,592 workers—3,290 TEPCO employees and 16,302 employees of contractor firms—were given health checks. The radiation doses were checked from 522 workers. Those were reported to the World Health Organization in February 2013. From this sample, 178 had experienced a dose of 100 millisieverts or more. After the U.N. Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, questioned the reliability of TEPCO´s thyroid gland dosage readings, the Japanese Health Ministry ordered TEPCO to review the internal dosage readings.&lt;ref name=ms130719/&gt;

The intake of radioactive iodine was calculated based on the radioactive caesium intake and other factors: the airborne iodine-to-caesium ratio on the days that the people worked at the reactor compound and other data. For one worker a reading was found of more than 1,000 millisieverts.&lt;ref name=ms130719/&gt;

According to the workers, TEPCO did little to inform them about the hazards of the intake of radioactive iodine.&lt;ref name="ms130719"/&gt; All workers with an estimated dose of 100 millisieverts were offered an annual ultrasound thyroid test during their lifetime for free. But TEPCO did not know how many of these people had received a medical screening already. A schedule for the thyroid gland test was not announced. TEPCO did not indicate what would be done if abnormalities were spotted during the tests.&lt;ref name="asahi"/&gt;

===Radiation within the primary containment of the reactors===
Within the [[Primary containment#Boiling water reactors|primary containment]] of reactors 1, 2, 3 and 4, widely varying levels of radiation were reported:

===Radiation outside primary containment of the reactors===
Outside the primary containment, plant radiation-level measurements have also varied significantly.

On 25 March, an analysis of stagnant water in the basement floor of the turbine building of Unit 1 showed heavy contamination.&lt;ref name="Regarding the result of concentration measurement in the stagnant water on the basement floor of the turbine building of Unit 1 of Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Station"/&gt;

On 27 March, TEPCO reported stagnant water in the basement of unit 2 (inside the reactor/turbine building complex, but outside the primary containment) was measured at 1000&amp;nbsp;mSv/h or more, which prompted evacuation. The exact dose rate remains unknown as the technicians fled the place after their first measurement went off-scale. Additional basement and trench-area measurements indicated 60&amp;nbsp;mSv/h in unit 1, "over 1000"&amp;nbsp;mSv/h&lt;ref name=TEPCO28/&gt; in unit 2, and 750&amp;nbsp;mSv/h in unit 3. The report indicated the main source was iodine-134&lt;ref name="HNK27"/&gt; with a half-life of less than an hour, which resulted in a radioactive iodine concentration 10&amp;nbsp;million times the normal value in the reactor.&lt;ref name=Reuters26/&gt; TEPCO later retracted its report, stating that the measurements were inaccurate and attributed the error to comparing the isotope responsible, [[isotopes of iodine|iodine-134]], to normal levels of another isotope.&lt;ref name=WNN27/&gt; Measurements were then corrected, stating that the iodine levels were 100,000 times the normal level.&lt;ref name="Japanese nuclear firm admits error on radiation reading"/&gt; On 28 March, the erroneous radiation measurement caused TEPCO to reevaluate the software used in analysis.&lt;ref name="nhk7"/&gt;

Measurements within the reactor/turbine buildings, but not in the basement and trench areas, were made on 18 April.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; These robotic measurements indicated up to 49&amp;nbsp;mSv/h in unit 1 and 57&amp;nbsp;mSv/h in unit 3.&lt;ref name="Walsh 2013"/&gt; This is substantially lower than the basement and trench readings, but still exceeds safe working levels without constant worker rotation.&lt;ref name="Walsh 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="asahi8"/&gt; Inside primary containment, levels are much higher.&lt;ref name="Walsh 2013"/&gt;

By 23 March 2011, neutron radiation had been observed outside the reactors 13 times at the Fukushima I site. While this could indicate ongoing [[nuclear fission|fission]], a [[criticality accident|recriticality event]] was not believed to account for these readings.&lt;ref name="archive9"/&gt; Based on those readings and TEPCO reports of high levels of chlorine-38, Dr. Ferenc Dalnoki-Veress speculated that transient criticalities may have occurred. However, Edwin Lyman at the Union of Concerned Scientists was skeptical, believing the reports of chlorine-38 to be in error.&lt;ref name="Has Fukushima's Reactor No. 1 Gone Critical?"/&gt; TEPCO's chlorine-38 report was later retracted.&lt;ref name="Tepco Retracts Chlorine, Arsenic Findings at Fukushima Station"/&gt; Noting that limited, uncontrolled chain reactions might occur at Fukushima I, a spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency ([[IAEA]]) "emphasized that the nuclear reactors won’t explode."&lt;ref name="tirone"/&gt;

On 15 April, TEPCO reported that nuclear fuel had melted and fallen to the lower containment sections of three of the [[Fukushima I]] reactors, including reactor three. The melted material was not expected to breach one of the lower containers, causing a serious radioactivity release. Instead, the melted fuel was thought to have dispersed uniformly across the lower portions of the containers of reactors No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3, making the resumption of the fission process, known as a "recriticality," most unlikely.&lt;ref name="globalsecuritynewswire"/&gt;

On 19 April, TEPCO estimated that the unit-2 turbine basement contained 25,000 cubic meters of contaminated water.&lt;ref name="TEPCOTransfer"/&gt; The water was measured to have 3 MBq/cm3 of Cs-137 and 13 MBq/cm3 of I-131: TEPCO characterized this level of contamination as "extremely high."&lt;ref name="TEPCOTransfer" /&gt; To attempt to prevent leakage to the sea, TEPCO planned to pump the water from the basement to the Centralized Radiation Waste Treatment Facility.&lt;ref name="TEPCOTransfer" /&gt;

A suspected hole from the melting of fuel in unit 1 has allowed water to leak in an unknown path from unit 1&lt;ref name="nhk10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fukushima reactor has a hole, leading to leakage"/&gt; which has exhibited radiation measurements "as high as 1,120 mSv/h."&lt;ref name="Radiation Readings in Fukushima Reactor Rise to Highest Since Crisis Began"/&gt;&lt;ref name="archive11"/&gt; Radioactivity measurements of the water in the unit-3 spent-fuel pool were reported at 140 kBq of radioactive caesium-134 per cubic centimeter, 150 kBq of caesium-137 per cubic centimeter, and 11 kBq per cubic centimeter of iodine-131 on 10 May.&lt;ref name="Radiation high at No.3 reactor pool"/&gt;

===Site contamination===

====Soil====
TEPCO have reported at three sites 500&amp;nbsp;meters from the reactors that the caesium-134 and caesium-137 levels in the soil are between 7.1 kBq and 530 kBq per kilo of undried soil.&lt;ref name="tepco"/&gt;

Small traces of plutonium have been found in the soil near the stricken reactors: repeated examinations of the soil suggest that the plutonium level is similar to the background level caused by atomic bomb tests.&lt;ref name="tepco13"/&gt; As the isotope signature of the plutonium is closer to that of power-reactor plutonium, TEPCO suggested that "two samples out of five may be the direct result of the recent incident."&lt;ref name="tepco14"/&gt; The more important thing to look at is the [[curium]] level in the soil;&lt;ref name="tepco15"/&gt; the soil does contain a short-lived isotope (curium-242) which shows that some [[alpha emitter]]s have been released in small amounts by the accident. The release of the beta/gamma emitters such as caesium-137 has been far greater. In the short and medium term the effects of the iodine and the caesium release will dominate the effect of the accident on farming and the general public. In common with almost all soils, the soil at the reactor site contains [[uranium]], but the concentration of uranium and the isotope signature&lt;ref name="tepco16"/&gt; suggests that the uranium is the normal, natural uranium in the soil.

Radioactive strontium-89 and strontium-90 were discovered in soil at the plant on 18 April, amounts detected in soil one-half kilometer from the facility ranging from 3.4 to 4400 Bq/kg of dry soil.&lt;ref name="NHKStrontium" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TEPCOStrontium" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TEPCOStrontiumSea" /&gt; Strontium remains in soil from above-ground nuclear testing; however, the amounts measured at the facility are approximately 130 times greater than the amount typically associated with previous nuclear testing.&lt;ref name="NHKStrontium" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TEPCOStrontiumSea" /&gt;

The isotope signature of the release looks very different from that of the Chernobyl accident:&lt;ref name="tepco17"/&gt; the Japanese accident has released much less of the involatile plutonium, minor actinides and fission products than Chernobyl did.

On 31 March, TEPCO reported that it had measured radioactivity in the plant-site groundwater which was 10,000 times the government limit. The company did not think that this radioactivity had spread to drinking water.&lt;ref name="Nuclear crisis puts evacuation zones under scrutiny"/&gt; NISA questioned the radioactivity measurement and TEPCO is re-evaluating it.&lt;ref name="JapanTimesApr1"/&gt; Some debris around the plant has been found to be highly radioactive, including a concrete fragment emanating 900&amp;nbsp;mSv/h.&lt;ref name="nhk18"/&gt;

====Air and direct radiation====
Air outside, but near, unit 3 was reported at 70&amp;nbsp;mSv/h on 26 April 2011.&lt;ref name="AsahiHighRad"/&gt; This was down from radiation levels as high as 130&amp;nbsp;mSv/h near units 1 and 3 in late March.&lt;ref name="AsahiHighRad" /&gt; Removal of debris reduced the radiation measurements from localized highs of up to 900&amp;nbsp;mSv/h to less than 100&amp;nbsp;mSv/h at all exterior locations near the reactors; however, readings of 160&amp;nbsp;mSv/h were still measured at the waste-treatment facility.&lt;ref name="Map details radiation at N-plant site"/&gt;

===Discharge to seawater and contaminated sealife===
Results revealed on 22 March from a sample taken by TEPCO about 100&amp;nbsp;m south of the discharge channel of units 1–4 showed elevated levels of Cs-137, [[Caesium-134|caesium-134 (Cs-134)]] and I-131.&lt;ref name=WNN22/&gt; A sample of seawater taken on 22 March 330&amp;nbsp;m south of the discharge channel (30&amp;nbsp;kilometers off the coastline) had elevated levels of I-131 and Cs-137. Also, north of the plant elevated levels of these isotopes were found on 22 March (as well as Cs-134, [[tellurium-129]] and tellurium-129m (Te-129m)), although the levels were lower.&lt;ref name=WNN24/&gt; Samples taken on 23 and/or 24 March contained about 80&amp;nbsp;Bq/mL of iodine-131 (1850 times the statutory limit) and 26&amp;nbsp;Bq/mL and caesium-137, most likely caused by atmospheric deposition.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt; By 26 and 27 March this level had decreased to 50&amp;nbsp;Bq/mL (11)&lt;ref name=tepco28/&gt; iodine-131 and 7&amp;nbsp;Bq/mL (2.9)&lt;ref name=tepco28/&gt; caesium-137 (80 times the limit).&lt;ref name="tepcobetu11"/&gt; Hidehiko Nishiyama, a senior NISA official, stated that radionuclide contamination would "be very diluted by the time it gets consumed by fish and seaweed."&lt;ref name=Reuters26/&gt; Above the seawater, IAEA reported "consistently low" dose rates of 0.04–0.1&amp;nbsp;μSv/h on 27 March.

By 29 March iodine-131 levels in seawater 330&amp;nbsp;m south of a key discharge outlet had reached 138&amp;nbsp;Bq/ml (3,355 times the legal limit),&lt;ref name="asahi.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="www3.nhk.or.jp"/&gt; and by 30 March, iodine-131 concentrations had reached 180&amp;nbsp;Bq/ml at the same location near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, 4,385 times the legal limit.&lt;ref name="www3.nhk.or.jp"/&gt; The high levels could be linked to a feared overflow of highly radioactive water that appeared to have leaked from the unit -2 turbine building.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"/&gt; On 15 April, I-131 levels were 6,500 times the legal limits.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; On 16 April, TEPCO began dumping zeolite, a mineral "that absorbs radioactive substances, aiming to slow down contamination of the ocean."&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt;

On 4 April, it was reported that the "operators of Japan's crippled power plant say they will release more than 10,000 tons of contaminated water into the ocean to make room in their storage tanks for water that is even more radioactive."&lt;ref name="voanews"/&gt; Measurements taken on 21 April indicated 186 Bq/l measured 34&amp;nbsp;km from the Fukushima plant; Japanese media reported this level of seawater contamination second to the [[Sellafield]] nuclear accident.&lt;ref name="asahi19"/&gt;

On 11 May, TEPCO announced it believed it had sealed a leak from unit 3 to the sea; TEPCO did not immediately announce the amount of radioactivity released by the leak.&lt;ref name="Tepco investigates new Fukushima leak"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seaweed"/&gt; On 13 May, Greenpeace announced that 10 of the 22 seaweed samples it had collected near the plant showed 10,000 Bq/Kg or higher, five times the Japanese standard for food of 2 kBq/kg for iodine-131 and 500 Bq/kg for radioactive caesium.&lt;ref name="Seaweed" /&gt;

In addition to the large releases of contaminated water (520 tons and 4.7 PBq&lt;ref name="tepco.co.jp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NHK520t" /&gt;) believed to have leaked from unit 2 from mid-March until early April, another release of radioactive water is believed to have contaminated the sea from unit 3, because on 16 May TEPCO announced seawater measurements of 200 Bq per cubic centimeter of caesium-134, 220 Bq per cubic centimeter of caesium-137, and unspecified high levels of iodine shortly after discovering a unit-3 leak.&lt;ref name="Water poses questions for Tepco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Radioactivity at intake of No.3 reactor rises"/&gt;

At two locations 20&amp;nbsp;kilometers north and south and 3&amp;nbsp;kilometers from the coast, TEPCO found [[strontium-89]] and [[strontium-90]] in the seabed soil. The samples were taken on 2 June. Up to 44 becquerels per kilogram of strontium-90 were detected, which has a half-life of 29 years. These isotopes were also found in soil and in seawater immediately after the accident. Samples taken from fish and seafood caught off the coast of Ibaraki and Chiba did not contain radioactive stontium.&lt;ref name="jaif20"/&gt;

As of October 2012, regular sampling of fish and other sea life off the coast of Fukushima showed that total caesium levels in bottom-dwelling fish were higher off Fukushima than elsewhere, with levels above regulatory limits, leading to a fishing ban for some species. Caesium levels had not decreased 1 year after the accident.&lt;ref name="Buesseler2012" /&gt;

Continuous monitoring of radioactivity levels in seafood by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) shows that for the Fukushima prefecture the proportion of catches which exceed Japanese safety standards has been decreasing continuously, falling below 2% in the second half of 2013 and below 0.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014. None of the fish caught in 2014 exceeded the less stringent pre-Fukushima standards.&lt;ref name="MAFF monitoring" /&gt; For the rest of Japan, the peak figure using the post-Fukushima standards was 4.7% immediately after the catastrophe, falling below 0.5% by mid-2012, and below 0.1% by mid-2013.&lt;ref name="MAFF monitoring" /&gt;

In February 2014, NHK reported that TEPCO was reviewing its radioactivity data, after finding much higher levels of radioactivity than was reported earlier. TEPCO now says that levels of 5 MBq of strontium per liter were detected in groundwater collected in July 2013 and not 0.9 MBq, as initially reported.&lt;ref name="Strontium-underreporting-NHK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Radiation-mismeasurement-YShimbun"/&gt;

==Radiation and nuclide detection in Japan==
Periodic overall reports of the situation in Japan are provided by the United States Department of Energy.&lt;ref name="The Situation in Japan"/&gt;

In April 2011, the United States Department of Energy published projections of the radiation risks over the next year (that is, for the future) for people living in the neighborhood of the plant. Potential exposure could exceed 20&amp;nbsp;mSv/year (2 rems/year) in some areas up to 50&amp;nbsp;kilometers from the plant. That is the level at which relocation would be considered in the USA, and it is a level that could cause roughly one extra cancer case in 500 young adults.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} However, natural radiation levels are higher in some parts of the world than the projected level mentioned above, and about 4 people out of 10 can be expected to develop cancer without exposure to radiation.&lt;ref name="Radiological Assessment of effects from Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A Map of Fukushima's Radiation Risks"/&gt; Further, the radiation exposure resulting from the incident for most people living in Fukushima is so small compared to background radiation that it may be impossible to find statistically significant evidence of increases in cancer.&lt;ref name="Science 2011" /&gt;

The highest detection of radiation outside of Fukushima peaked at 40 mSv. This represents a much lower level then the amount required to increase a persons risk of cancer. 100 mSv represents the level at which a definitive increased risk of cancer occurs. Radiation above this level increases the risk of cancer, and after 400 mSv radiation poisoning can occur, but is unlikely to be fatal.&lt;ref name="phyast.pitt.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blacksmithinstitute.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt;

The zone within 20&amp;nbsp;km from the plant was evacuated on 12 March,&lt;ref name="wp-partial"/&gt; while residents within a distance of up to 30&amp;nbsp;km were advised to stay indoors. IAEA reported on 14 March that about 150 people in the vicinity of the plant "received monitoring for radiation levels"; 23 of these people were also decontaminated.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt; From 25 March, nearby residents were encouraged to participate in voluntary evacuation.&lt;ref name="Japan steps up nuclear plant precautions; Kan apologizes"/&gt;

At a distance of {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the site, radiation of 3–170&amp;nbsp;μSv/h was measured to the north-west on 17 March, while it was 1–5&amp;nbsp;μSv/h in other directions.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt;&lt;ref name=NHK18/&gt; Experts said exposure to this amount of radiation for 6 to 7&amp;nbsp;hours would result in absorption of the maximum level considered safe for one year.&lt;ref name="NHK18"/&gt; On 16 March [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Japan's ministry of science]] measured radiation levels of up to 330&amp;nbsp;μSv/h 20&amp;nbsp;kilometers northwest of the power plant.&lt;ref name=NHK16/&gt; At some locations around 30&amp;nbsp;km from the Fukushima plant, the dose rates rose significantly in 24&amp;nbsp;hours on 16–17 March: in one location from 80 to 170&amp;nbsp;μSv/h and in another from 26 to 95&amp;nbsp;μSv/h. The levels varied according to the direction from the plant.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt; In most locations, the levels remained well below the levels required to damage human health, as the recommended annual maximum limit is well below the level that would affect human health.&lt;ref name="phyast.pitt.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blacksmithinstitute.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt;

[[background radiation|Natural exposure]] varies from place to place but delivers a [[dose equivalent]] in the vicinity of 2.4&amp;nbsp;[[sievert|mSv]]/year, or about 0.3&amp;nbsp;µSv/h.&lt;ref name="IAEA1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="worldnuclearinf05"/&gt; For comparison, one chest x-ray is about 0.2&amp;nbsp;mSv and an abdominal CT scan is supposed to be less than 10&amp;nbsp;mSv (but it has been reported that some abdominal CT scans can deliver as much as 90&amp;nbsp;mSv).&lt;ref name="Medical Imaging"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Second Thoughts About CT Imaging"/&gt; People can mitigate their exposure to radiation through a variety of [[Radiation protection|protection techniques]].

On 22 April 2011 a Japanese government report was presented by Minister of Trade Yukio Edano to leaders of the town Futaba. In it predictions were made about radioactivity releases for the years 2012 up to 2132. According to this report, in several parts of Fukushima Prefecture – including Futaba and Okuma – the air would remain dangerously radioactive at levels above 50 millisieverts a year. This was all based on measurements done in November 2011.&lt;ref name="japantimes"/&gt;

In August 2012, Japanese academic researchers announced that 10,000 people living near the plant in Minamisoma City at the time of the accident had been exposed to well less than 1 millisievert of radiation. The researchers stated that the health dangers from such exposure was "negligible". Said participating researcher Masaharu Tsubokura, "Exposure levels were much lower than those reported in studies even several years after the Chernobyl incident."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt;

===Most detailed radiation map published by the Japanese government===
A detailed map was published by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, going online on 18 October 2011. The map contains the caesium concentrations and radiation levels caused by the airborne radioactivity from the Fukushima nuclear reactor. This website contains both web-based and PDF versions of the maps, providing information by municipality as had been the case previously, but also measurements by district. The maps were intended to help the residents who had called for better information on contamination levels between areas of the same municipalities, using soil and air sample data already released. A grid is laid over a map of most of eastern Japan. Selecting a square in the grid zooms in on that area, at which point users can choose more detailed maps displaying airborne contamination levels, caesium-134 or -137 levels, or total caesium levels.

===Ground and water contamination within 30 kilometers===
The unrecovered bodies of approximately 1,000 quake and tsunami victims within the plant's evacuation zone are believed to be inaccessible at the time of 1 April 2011 due to detectable levels of radiation.&lt;ref name="japantimes3"/&gt;

===Air exposure outside of 30 kilometers===
{{see also|Radiation monitoring in Japan}}
[[File:Radiation.jpg|thumb|right|Tokyo low-level gamma radiation with comparisons to average annual radiation intake. Based on Geiger counter measurements in Tokyo. ''Does not show radiation from physically transported sources, i.e. particulate matter transported in food, water, or the atmosphere.'']]
Radiation levels in Tokyo on 15 March were at one point measured at 0.809&amp;nbsp;μ[[Sievert|Sv]]/hour although they were later reported to be at "about twice the normal level".&lt;ref name="eiken, radiation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newstalkzb"/&gt; Later, on 15 March 2011, Edano reported that radiation levels were lower and the average radiation dose rate over the whole day was 0.109&amp;nbsp;μSv/h.&lt;ref name="eiken, radiation" /&gt; The wind direction on 15 March dispersed radioactivity away from the land and back over the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name="ABC15"/&gt; On 16 March, the Japanese radiation warning system, SPEEDI, indicated high levels of radioactivity would spread further than 30&amp;nbsp;km from the plant, but Japanese authorities did not relay the information to citizens because "the location or the amount of radioactive leakage was not specified at the time."&lt;ref name="nhk22"/&gt; From 17 March, IAEA received regular updates on radiation from 46 cities and indicated that they had remained stable and were "well below levels which are dangerous to human health".&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt; In hourly measurements of these cities until 20 March, no significant changes were reported.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt;

On 18 June 2012 it became known that from 17 to 19 March 2011 in the days directly after the explosions, American military aircraft gathered radiation data in an area with a radius of 45&amp;nbsp;kilometers around the plant for the U.S. Department of Energy. The maps revealed radiation levels of more than 125 microsieverts per hour at 25&amp;nbsp;kilometers northwest of the plant, which means that people in these areas were exposed to the annual permissible dose within eight hours. The maps were neither made public nor used for evacuation of residents.

On 18 March 2011 the U.S. government sent the data through the Japanese Foreign Ministry to the NISA under the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, and the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology got the data on 20 March.

The data were not forwarded to the prime minister's office and the Nuclear Safety Commission, and subsequently not used to direct the evacuation of the people living around the plant. Because a substantial portion of radioactive materials released from the plant went northwest and fell onto the ground, and some residents were "evacuated" in this direction, these people could have avoided unnecessary exposure to radiation had the data been published directly. According to Tetsuya Yamamoto, chief nuclear safety officer of the Nuclear Safety Agency, "It was very regrettable that we didn't share and utilize the information." But an official of the Science and Technology Policy Bureau of the technology ministry, Itaru Watanabe, said it was more appropriate for the United States, rather than Japan, to release the data.&lt;ref name="mainichi23"/&gt; On 23 March - after the Americans - Japan released its own fallout maps, compiled by Japanese authorities from measurements and predictions from the computer simulations of SPEEDI. On 19 June 2012 Minister of Science Hirofumi Hirano said that Japan would review the decision of the Science Ministry and the Nuclear-Safety Agency in 2011 to ignore the radiation maps provided by the United States. He defended his ministry's handling of the matter with the remark that its task was to measure radiation levels on land. But the government should reconsider its decision not to publish the maps or use the information. Studies would be done by the authorities, whether the maps could have been a help with the evacuations.&lt;ref name="nhk24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jaif25"/&gt;

On 30 March 2011, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] stated that its operational criteria for evacuation were exceeded in the village of [[Iitate, Fukushima]], {{convert|39|km|miles|abbr=off}} north-west of Fukushima I, outside the existing {{convert|30|km|miles|abbr=off}} radiation exclusion zone. The IAEA advised the Japanese authorities to carefully assess the situation there.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; Experts from Kyoto University and Hiroshima University released a study of soil samples, on 11 April, that revealed that "as much as 400 times the normal levels of radiation could remain in communities beyond a 30-kilometer radius from the Fukushima" site.&lt;ref name="High radiation levels found beyond 30-km radius"/&gt;

Urine samples taken from 10 children in the capital of Fukushima Prefecture were analyzed in a French laboratory. All of them contained caesium-134. The sample of an eight-year-old girl contained 1.13 becquerels/liter. The children were living up to 60&amp;nbsp;kilometers away from the troubled nuclear power plant. The Fukushima Network for Saving Children urged the Japanese government to check the children in Fukushima. The Japanese non-profit Radiation Effects Research Foundation said that people should not overreact, because there are no reports known of health problems with these levels of radiation.&lt;ref name="jaif26"/&gt;

====Radioactive dust particles====
On 31 October 2011 a scientist from the [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]], Marco Kaltofen, presented his findings on the releases of radioactive isotopes from the Fukushima accidents at the annual meeting of the American Public Health Association (APHA). Airborne dust contaminated with radioactive particles was released from the reactors into the air. This dust was found in Japanese car filters: they contained caesium-134 and caesium-137, and cobalt at levels as high as 3 nCi total activity per sample. Materials collected during April 2011 from Japan also contained iodine-131. Soil and settled dust were collected from outdoors and inside homes, and also from used children's shoes. High levels of caesium were found on the shoelaces. US air-filter and dust samples did not contain "hot" particles, except for air samples collected in Seattle, Washington in April 2011. Dust particles contaminated with radioactive caesium were found more than 100&amp;nbsp;miles from the Fukushima site, and could be detected on the U.S. West Coast.&lt;ref name="confex"/&gt;

===Ground, water and sewage contamination outside of 30 kilometers===

Tests concluded between 10 and 20 April revealed radioactive caesium in amounts of 2.0&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;3.2&amp;nbsp;kBq/kg in soil from the Tokyo districts of Chiyoda and Koto, respectively.&lt;ref name="Highly Radioactive Substances Detected in Tokyo"/&gt; On 5 May, government officials announced that radioactivity levels in Tokyo sewage had spiked in late March.&lt;ref name="Seaweed" /&gt; Simple-sum measurements of all radioactive isotopes in sewage burned at a Tokyo treatment plant measured 170,000&amp;nbsp;Bq/kg "in the immediate wake of the Fukushima nuclear crisis".&lt;ref name="Seaweed" /&gt; The government announced that the reason for the spike was unclear, but suspected rainwater.&lt;ref name="Seaweed" /&gt; The 5 May announcement further clarified that as of 28 April, the radioactivity level in Tokyo sewage was 16,000&amp;nbsp;Bq/kg.&lt;ref name="Seaweed" /&gt;

A detailed map of ground contamination within 80&amp;nbsp;kilometers of the plant, the joint product of the U.S. Department of Energy and the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology ([[MEXT]]), was released on 6 May.&lt;ref name="JointSurvey"/&gt; The map showed that a belt of contamination, with radioactivity from 3&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;14.7&amp;nbsp;MBq caesium-137 per square meter, spread to the northwest of the nuclear plant.&lt;ref name="JointSurvey" /&gt; For comparison, areas with activity levels with more than 0.55&amp;nbsp;MBq caesium-137 per square meter were abandoned after the 1986 Chernobyl accident.&lt;ref name="JointSurvey" /&gt; The village of Iitate and the town of Namie are impacted.&lt;ref name="JointSurvey" /&gt; Similar data was used to establish a map that would calculate the amount of radiation a person would be exposed to if a person were to stay outdoors for eight&amp;nbsp;hours per day through 11 March 2012.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Scientists preparing this map, as well as earlier maps, targeted a 20&amp;nbsp;mSv/a dosage target for evacuation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The government's 20&amp;nbsp;mSv/a target led to the resignation of Toshiso Kosako, Special Adviser on radiation safety issues to Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan, who stated "I cannot allow this as a scholar", and argued that the target is too high, especially for children; he also criticized the increased limit for plant workers.&lt;ref name="www"/&gt; In response, parents' groups and schools in some smaller towns and cities in Fukushima Prefecture have organized decontamination of soil surrounding schools, defying orders from Tokyo asserting that the schools are safe.&lt;ref name="NYTAngryParents"/&gt; Eventually, the Fukushima education board plans to replace the soil at 26 schools with the highest radiation levels.&lt;ref name="NYTAngryParents" /&gt;

Anomalous "hot spots" have been discovered in areas far beyond the adjacent region. For example, experts cannot explain how radioactive caesium from the reactors at Fukushima ended up in Kanagawa more than {{convert|300|km|mi|sp=us}} to the south.&lt;ref name="wsj"/&gt;

In the first week of September the Ministry of Science published a new map showing radiation levels in Fukushima and four surrounding prefectures, based on the results of an aerial survey. In the map, different colors were used to show the level of radiation at locations one meter above the ground.
* Red: 19 microsieverts per hour or higher. The red band pointed in a north-west direction and was more than 30&amp;nbsp;kilometers long.
* Yellow: radiation between 3.8 and 19 microsieverts per hour. This corresponds to less than a chest X-ray to 3 chest X-rays. This is the threshold to designate an area an evacuation zone. The yellow area extended far beyond the evacuation zone already put into place.
* Light green: radiation between 0.5 and one microsieverts per hour. This was still far above the annual level of one hundred millisievert, which should cause no harm to people. This zone contained most of Fukushima Prefecture, southern parts of Miyagi Prefecture, and northern parts of Tochigi and Ibaraki prefectures.&lt;ref name="jaif27"/&gt;

Up to 307,000 [[becquerel]]s of caesium per kilogram of soil were detected during a survey held in [[Fukushima City]], 60&amp;nbsp;kilometers away from the crippled reactors, on 14 September 2011. This was triple the amount for contaminated soil that by Japanese governmental orders should be sealed into concrete. According to "Citizens Against Fukushima Aging Nuclear Power Plants", these readings were comparable to the high levels in special regulated zones where evacuation was required after the Chernobyl accident. They urged the government to designate the area as a hot spot, where residents would need to voluntarily evacuate and be eligible for state assistance. Professor Tomoya Yamauchi of the [[University of Kobe]], in charge of the study, in which soil samples were tested from five locations around the district, noted that the decontamination conducted in some of the areas tested has not yet reduced the radiation to pre-accident levels.&lt;ref name="mainichi28"/&gt;

On 18 October 2011 a hot-spot in a public square was found in the city of [[Kashiwa]], [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]] in the Nedokoyadai district, by a resident walking with a dosimeter. He informed the city council. Their first readings were off the scale, as their Geiger-counter could measure up to 10 microsieverts per hour. Later measurements by the Chiba environment foundation reported a final result of 57.5 microsieverts per hour. On 21 October the roads around the place were sealed off, and the place was covered with sandbags three meters thick. Further investigations and check-ups were planned on 24 October 2011.&lt;ref name="mainichi29"/&gt; These investigations showed on 23 October levels up to 276,000 becquerels radioactive caesium per kilogram of soil, 30 centimeters below the surface. The first comments of town officials on the find of 57.7 microsieverts per hour were that there could not be a link with the Fukushima disaster, but after the find of this large amount of caesium, officials of the Science Ministry could not deny the possibility that the cause could be found at the Fukushima-site.&lt;ref name="mainichi30"/&gt;

In October 2011, radiation levels as high as those in the evacuation zone around Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant were detected in a Tokyo suburb. Japanese officials said the contamination was linked to the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Contamination levels "as high as those inside Fukushima's no-go zone have been detected, with officials speculating that the hotspot was created after radioactive caesium carried in rain water became concentrated because of a broken gutter".&lt;ref name="Radiation hotspot found in Tokyo"/&gt;

In October 2011 the Japanese Ministry of Science launched a phone hotline to deal with concerns about radiation exposure outside Fukushima Prefecture. Concerned Japanese citizens had been walking with Geiger-counters through their locality in search of all places with raised radiation levels. Whenever a site was found with a radiation dose at one meter above the ground more than one microsievert per hour and higher than nearby areas, this should be mentioned at the hotline. One microsievert per hour is the limit above this topsoil at school playgrounds would be removed, subsidized by the state of Japan. Local governments were asked to carry out simple decontamination works, such as clearing mud from ditches if necessary. When radiation levels would remain more than one microsievert higher than nearby areas even after the cleaning, the ministry offered to help with further decontamination. On the website of the ministry a guideline was posted on how to measure radiation levels in a proper way, how to hold the dosimeter and how long to wait for a proper reading.&lt;ref name="nhk31"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jaif32"/&gt;

In October 2011 hotspots were reported on the grounds of two elementary schools in [[Abiko, Chiba|Abiko]] in [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]]:
* 11.3 microsieverts per hour was detected on 25 September just above the surface of the ground near a ditch in the compounds of the Abiko Municipal Daiichi Elementary School. At 50 centimeters above the ground the reading was 1.7 microsieverts per hour. The soil in the ditch contained 60,768 becquerels per kilogram. After the soil was removed, the radiation decreased to 0.6 microsieverts per hour at 50 centimeters above groundlevel.
* 10.1 microsieverts per hour was found at the Abiko Municipal Namiki Elementary School near the surface of the ground where sludge removed from the swimming pool of the school had been buried. The area was covered with a waterproof tarp and dirt was put on top of the tarp to decrease the radiation; 0.6 microsieverts per hour was measured 50 centimeters above the ground after this was done.&lt;ref name="mainichi33"/&gt;

Radioactive caesium was found in waste water discharged into Tokyo Bay from a cement factory in the prefecture [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]] east of Tokio. In September and October two water samples were taken, measuring 1,103 becquerels per liter and 1,054 becquerels per liter respectively. These were 14 to 15 times higher than the limit set by [[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency|NISA]]. Ash from incinerators in the prefecture constituted the raw material to produce cement. In this process toxic substances are filtered out of the ashes, and the water used to clean these filters was discharged into Tokyo Bay. On 2 November 2011 this waste-water discharge was halted, and the Japanese authorities started a survey on the caesium contamination of the seawater of Tokyo Bay near the plant.&lt;ref name="nhk34"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jaif35"/&gt;

====Caesium-134 and caesium-137 soil contamination map====
On 12 November the Japanese government published a contamination map compiled by helicopter. This map covered a much wider area than before. Six new prefectures [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]], [[Yamanashi Prefecture|Yamanashi]], [[Nagano Prefecture|Nagano]], [[Shizuoka Prefecture|Shizuoka]], [[Gifu Prefecture|Gifu]], and [[Toyama Prefecture|Toyama]] were included in this new map of the soil radioactivity of caesium-134 and caesium-137 in Japan. Contamination between 30,000 and 100,000 becquerels per square meter was found in [[Ichinoseki]] and [[Ōshū, Iwate|Oshu]] (prefecture [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]]), in [[Saku, Nagano|Saku]], [[Karuizawa]] and [[Sakuho]] (prefecture [[Nagano Prefecture|Nagano]], in [[Tabayama]] (prefecture [[Yamanashi Prefecture|Yamanashi]]) and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="mainichi36"/&gt;

====Computer simulations of caesium contamination====
Based on radiation measurements made all over Japan between 20 March and 20 April 2011, and the atmospheric patterns in that period, computer simulations were performed by an international team of researchers, in cooperation with the [[University of Nagoya]], in order to estimate the spread of radioactive materials like caesium-137. Their results, published in two studies&lt;ref name="DoipnasMissing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Assessment of individual radionuclide distributions from the Fukushima nuclear accident covering central-east Japan"/&gt; on 14 November 2011, suggested that caesium-137 reached up to the northernmost island of [[Hokkaido]], and the regions of [[Chugoku]] and [[Shikoku]] in western Japan at more than 500&amp;nbsp;kilometers from the Fukushima plant. Rain accumulated the caesium in the soil. Measured radioactivity per kilogram reached 250 becquerels in eastern Hokkaido, and 25 becquerels in the mountains of western Japan. According to the research group, these levels were not high enough to require decontamination. Professor Tetsuzo Yasunari of the University of Nagoya called for a national soil-testing program because of the nationwide spread of radioactive material, and suggested identified hotspots, places with high radiation levels, should be marked with warning signs.&lt;ref name="nhk37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jaif38"/&gt;

The first study concentrated on caesium-137. Around the nuclear plant, places were found containing up to 40.000 becquerels/kg, 8 times the governmental safety limit of 5.000 becquerels/kg. Places further away were just below this maximum. East and north-east from the plant the soil was contaminated the most. North-west and westwards the soil was less contaminated, because of mountain protection.

The second study had a wider scope, and was meant to study the geographic spread of more-radioactive isotopes, like tellurium and iodine. Because these isotopes deposit themselves in the soil with rain, Norikazu Kinoshita and his colleagues observed the effect of two specific rain-showers on 15 and 21 March 2011. The rainfall on 15 March contaminated the grounds around the plant; the second shower transported the radioactivity much further from the plant, in the direction of Tokyo. According to the authors, the soil should be decontaminated, but when this is found impossible, farming should be limited.&lt;ref name="www39"/&gt;

====Elementary school yard in Tokyo====
On 13 December 2011 extremely high readings of radioactive caesium – 90,600 becquerels per kilogram, 11 times the governmental limit of 8000 becquerels – were detected in a groundsheet at the Suginami Ward elementary school in Tokyo at a distance of 230&amp;nbsp;kilometers from Fukushima. The sheet was used to protect the school lawn against frost from 18 March until 6 April 2011. Until November this sheet was stored alongside a gymnasium. In places near this storage area up to 3.95 microsieverts per hour were measured one centimeter above the ground. The school planned to burn the sheet. Further inspections were requested.&lt;ref name="nhk40"/&gt;

===Radiation exposure in the city of Fukushima===
All citizens of the town Fukushima received dosimeters to measure the precise dose of radiation to which they were exposed. After September the city of Fukushima collected the 36,478 "glass badges" of dosimeters from all its citizens for analysis. It turned out that 99 percent had not been exposed to more than 0.3 millisieverts in September 2011, except four young children from one family: a girl, in third year elementary school, had received 1.7 millisieverts, and her three brothers had been exposed to 1.4 to 1.6 millisieverts. Their home was situated near a highly radioactive spot, and after this find the family moved out of Fukushima Prefecture. A city official said that this kind of exposure would not affect their health.&lt;ref name="mainichi41"/&gt;

Similar results were obtained for a three-month period from September 2011: among a group of 36,767 residents in Fukushima city, 36,657 had been exposed to less than 1 millisievert, and the average dose was 0.26 millisieverts. For 10 residents, the readings ranged from 1.8 to 2.7 millisieverts, but these values are mostly believed to be related to usage errors (dosimeters left outside or exposed to X-ray luggage screening).&lt;ref name="mainichi42"/&gt;

===Disposal of radioactive ash===
Due to objections from concerned residents it became more and more difficult to dispose of the ashes of burned household garbage in and around Tokyo. The ashes of waste facilities in the [[Tōhoku region|Tohoku]], [[Kantō region|Kanto]] and [[Kōshin'etsu region]]s were proven to be contaminated with radioactive caesium. According to the guidelines of the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of Environment]], ashes radiating 8,000 becquerels per kilogram or lower could be buried. Ashes with caesium levels between 8,000 and 100,000 becquerels should be secured, and buried in concrete vessels. A survey was done on 410 sites of waste-disposal facilities, on how the ash disposal was proceeding. At 22 sites, mainly in the Tokyo Metropolitan area, the ashes with levels under 8000 becquerels could not be buried due to the objections of concerned residents. At 42 sites, ashes were found that contained over 8,000 becquerels of caesium, which could not be buried. The ministry made plans to send officials to meetings in the municipalities to explain to the Japanese people that the waste disposal was done safely, and to demonstrate how the disposal of the ashes above 8000 becquerels was conducted.&lt;ref name="jaif43"/&gt;

On 5 January 2012 the Nambu (south) Clean Center, a waste incinerator in [[Kashiwa, Chiba]], was taken out of production by the city council because the storage room was completely filled with 200 metric tons of radioactive ash that could not disposed of in landfills. Storage at the plant was full, with 1049 drums, and some 30 tons more were still to be taken out of the incinerator. In September 2011, the factory was closed for two months for the same reason. The Center's special advanced procedures were able to minimize the volume of the ash, but radioactive caesium was concentrated to levels above the national limit of 8.000 becquerels per kilogram for waste disposal in landfills. It was not possible to secure new storage space for the radioactive ash. Radiation levels in Kashiwa were higher than in surrounding areas, and ashes containing up to 70,800 becquerels of radioactive caesium per kilogram – higher than the national limit – were detected in the city. Other cities around Kashiwa were facing the same problem: radioactive ash was piling up. Chiba prefecture asked [[Abiko, Chiba|Abiko]] and [[Inzai, Chiba|Inzai]] to accept temporary storage at the Teganuma waste-disposal facility located at their border. But this met strong opposition from their citizens.&lt;ref name="mainichi44"/&gt;

===Deposition of radioactivity and effect on agricultural products and building materials===
Radiation monitoring in all 47 [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]] showed wide variation, but an upward trend in 10 of them on 23 March. No deposition could be determined in 28 of them until 25 March&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt; The highest value obtained was in Ibaraki (480&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on 25 March) and Yamagata (750&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on 26 March) for iodine-13. For caesium-137, the highest values were in Yamagata at 150 and 1200&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; respectively.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt;

Measurements made in Japan in a number of locations have shown the presence of [[radionuclide]]s in the ground.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt; On 19 March, upland soil levels of 8,100&amp;nbsp;Bq/kg of Cs-137 and 300,000&amp;nbsp;Bq/kg of I-131 were reported. One day later, the measured levels were 163,000&amp;nbsp;Bq/kg of Cs-137 and 1,170,000&amp;nbsp;Bq/kg of I-131.&lt;ref name="Mext"/&gt;

On 19 March, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced that levels of radioactivity exceeding legal limits had been detected in milk produced in the Fukushima area and in certain vegetables in Ibaraki. On 21 March, IAEA confirmed that "in some areas, iodine-131 in milk and in freshly grown leafy vegetables, such as spinach and spring onions, is significantly above the levels set by Japan for restricting consumption". One day later, iodine-131 (sometimes above safe levels) and caesium-137 (always at safe levels) detection was reported in Ibaraki prefecture.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt; On 21 March, levels of radioactivity in spinach grown in the open air in Kitaibaraki city in [[Ibaraki Prefecture|Ibaraki]], around 75&amp;nbsp;kilometers south of the nuclear plant, were 24,000&amp;nbsp;[[becquerel (Bq)]]/kg of iodine-131, 12 times more than the limit of 2,000&amp;nbsp;Bq/kg, and 690&amp;nbsp;Bq/kg of caesium, 190&amp;nbsp;Bq/kg above the limit.&lt;ref name=spinach/&gt; In four Prefectures (Ibaraki, Totigi, Gunma, Fukushima), distribution of spinach and [[kakina]] was restricted as well as milk from Fukushima.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt; On 23 March, similar restrictions were placed on more leafy vegetables ([[komatsuna]], cabbages) and all flowerheads [[brassica]]s (like cauliflower) in Fukushima, while [[parsley]] and milk distribution was restricted in Ibaraki.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt; On 24 March, IAEA reported that virtually all milk samples and vegetable samples taken in Fukushima and Ibaraki on 18–21 and 16–22 March respectively were above the limit. Samples from Chiba, Ibaraki and Tochigi also had excessive levels in [[celery]], parsley, spinach and other leafy vegetables. In addition, certain samples of beef mainly taken on 27–show of 29 Marched concentrations of iodine-131 and/or caesium-134 and caesium-137 above the regulatory levels.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt;

After the detection of radioactive [[caesium]] above legal limits in [[Sand lance]]s caught off the coast of [[Ibaraki Prefecture]], the government of the prefecture banned such fishing.&lt;ref name="NHK World 20110405"/&gt; On 11 May, caesium levels in tea leaves from a prefecture "just south of Tokyo" were reported to exceed government limits: this was the first agricultural product from Kanagawa Prefecture that exceeded safety limits.&lt;ref name="Radiation Detected in Tea Leaves in Japan"/&gt; In addition to Kanagawa Prefecture, agricultural products from Tochigi and Ibaraki prefectures have also been found to exceed the government limits, for example, pasture grass collected on 5 May, measured 3,480&amp;nbsp;Bq/kg of radioactive caesium, approximately 11 times the state limit of 300&amp;nbsp;becquerels.&lt;ref name="Radioactive element detected in grass, vegetables"/&gt; Even into July [[radioactive]] beef was found on sale in eleven [https://web.archive.org/web/20110715040325/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110712p2g00m0dm031000c.html prefectures], as far away as [[Kōchi Prefecture|Kōchi]] and [[Hokkaido]]. Authorities explained that until that point testing had been performed on the skin and exterior of livestock. Animal feed and meat cuts had not been checked for radioactivity previously.&lt;ref name="Bend Health News, Videos, Resources and More from"/&gt;

Hay and straw were found contaminated with caesium {{convert|80|km}} from the reactors and outside the evacuation zone. The news of the contamination of foods with radioactive substances leaking from the Fukushima nuclear reactors damaged the mutual trust between local food producers, including farmers, and consumers. The source of caesium was found to be rice straw that had been fed to the animals. A notice from the Japanese government that was sent to cattle farmers after the nuclear accident made no mention of the possibility that rice straw could be contaminated with radioactive materials from the fallout.&lt;ref name="mainichi45"/&gt; Beef from Fukushima Prefecture was removed from the distribution channels. Health minister Kohei Otsuka stated on 17 July 2011 that this removal might not be sufficient. The urine of all cattle for sale was tested in order to return those cows that showed levels of radioactive substances higher than the government-set limit to farms so they could be decontaminated by feeding them safe hay. The minister said that the government should try to buy uncontaminated straw and hay in other parts of the country and offer this to the farmers in the affected areas.&lt;ref name="japantimes46"/&gt; All transport of beef raised in the prefecture Fukushima was &lt;!-- will be --&gt; prohibited after 19 July. The meat of some 132 cows was sold to at least 36 of the 47 prefectures of Japan. In more and more places contaminated meat was found.&lt;ref name="www47"/&gt;

In March 2012 up to 18,700 becquerels per kilogram radioactive caesium was detected in [[yamame]], or landlocked masu salmon, caught in the [[Niida]] river near the town [[Iitate, Fukushima|Iitate]], which was over 37 times the legal limit of 500 becquerels/kg. The fish was caught for testing purposes prior to the opening of the fishing season. Fishing cooperatives were asked to refrain from catching and eating yamame fish from this river and all streams adjacent to it. No fish was sold in local markets.&lt;ref name="mainichi48"/&gt;

No fishing was allowed in the river [[Nojiri River|Nojiri]] in the region Okuaizu in Fukushima after-mid March 2012. The fish caught in this river contained 119 to 139 becquerels of radioactive caesium per kilogram, although this river is located some 130&amp;nbsp;kilometers from the damaged reactors. In 2011 at this place the fish measured about 50 becquerels per kilogram, and the fishing season was opened as usual. But fishing was not popular in 2011. Local people hoped it would be better in 2012. After the new findings the fishing season was postponed.&lt;ref name="mainichi49"/&gt;

On 28 March 2012 [[smelt (fish)|smelt]] caught in the [[Akagi Onuma]] lake near the city of [[Maebashi]] in the prefecture [[Gunma Prefecture|Gunma]] was found to be contaminated with 426 becquerels per kilogram of caesium.&lt;ref name="mdn.mainichi.jp"/&gt;

In April 2012 radioactive caesium concentrations of 110 becquerels per kilogram were found in [[silver carp|silver crucian carp fish]] caught in the [[Tone River]] north of Tokyo, some 180&amp;nbsp;kilometers away from the Fukushima Daiichi Plant. Six fishery cooperatives and 10 towns along the river were asked to stop all shipments of fish caught in the river. In March 2012 fish and shellfish caught in a pond near the same river were found to contain levels above the new legal limits of 100 becquerels per kilogram.&lt;ref name="jaif50"/&gt;

The Dutch bio-farming company Waterland International and a Japanese federation of farmers made an agreement in March 2012 to plant and grow [[camellia]] on 2000 to 3000&amp;nbsp;hectare. The seeds will be used to produce bio-diesel, which could be used to produce electricity. According to director William Nolten the region had a big potential for the production of clean energy. Some 800,000&amp;nbsp;hectares in the region could not be used to produce food anymore, and after the disaster because of fears for contamination the Japanese people refused to buy food produced in the region anyway. Experiments would be done to find out whether camelia was capable of extracting caesium from the soil. An experiment with [[sunflowers]] had no success.&lt;ref name="www51"/&gt;

High levels of radioactive caesium were found in 23 varieties of freshwater fish sampled at five rivers and lakes in Fukushima Prefecture between December 2011 and February 2012 and in 8 locations on the open sea. On 2 July 2012 the Ministry of the Environment published that it had found radioactive caesium between 61 and 2,600 becquerels per kilogram. 2,600 becquerels were found in a kind of goby caught in Mano River, which flows from [[Iitate, Fukushima|Iitate Village]] to the city of [[Minamisōma, Fukushima|Minamisoma]], north of the nuclear plant. Water bugs, common food for freshwater fish, also showed high levels of 330 to 670 becquerels per kilogram. Marine fish was found less contaminated and showed levels between 2.15 and 260 Bq/kg. Marine fish might be more capable of excreting caesium from their bodies, because saltwater fish have the ability to excrete salt. The Japanese Ministry of the Environment would closely monitor freshwater fish as radioactive caesium might remain for much longer periods in their bodies. According to Japanese regulations, food is considered safe for consumption up to a maximum of 100 Bq/kg.&lt;ref name="mainichi52"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jaif53"/&gt;

In August 2012, the Health ministry found that caesium levels had dropped to undetectable levels in most cultivated vegetables from the affected area, while food sourced from forests, rivers or lakes in the Tohoku and northern Kanto regions are showing excessive contamination.&lt;ref name="japtimes25Sep12"/&gt;

In a 'murasoi'-fish (or rock-fish Sebastes pachycephalus) caught in January 2013 at the coast of Fukushima an enormous amount of radioactive caesium was found: 254,000 becquerel/kilogram, or 2540 times the legal limitm in Japan for seafood.&lt;ref name="yahoo54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="volkskrant"/&gt;

On 21 February 2013 a greenling - 38 centimeters long and weighing 564&amp;nbsp;grams - was caught near a water intake of the reactor units. It did set a new record: containing 740,000 becquerels radioactive caesium per kilogram, 7,400 times the Japanese limit deemed safe for human consumption. The previous record of caesium concentration in fish was 510,000 Bq/kg detected in another greenling. On the sea floor a net was installed by TEPCO, in order to prevent migrating fish to escape from the contaminated area.&lt;ref name="mainichi55"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tepco56"/&gt;

====Cattle and beef====
As of July 2011, the Japanese government has been unable to control the spread of radioactive material into the nation's food, and "Japanese agricultural officials say meat from more than 500 cattle that were likely to have been contaminated with radioactive caesium has made its way to supermarkets and restaurants across Japan".&lt;ref name="Hiroko Tabuchi"/&gt; On 22 July it became known that at least 1400 cows were shipped from 76 farms that were fed with contaminated hay and rice-straw that had been distributed by agents in Miyagi and farmers in the prefectures of Fukushima and Iwate, near the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Supermarkets and other stores were asking their customers to return the meat. Farmers were asking for help, and the Japanese government was considering whether it should buy and burn all this suspect meat.&lt;ref name="jaif57"/&gt; Beef had 2% more Caesium then the governments strict limits.&lt;ref name="Latest stories on Japan earthquake"/&gt;

On 26 July more than 2,800 cattle carcasses, fed with caesium-contaminated food, had been shipped for public consumption to 46 of the 47 prefectures in Japan, with only Okinawa remaining free. Part of this beef, which had reached the markets, still needed to be tested. In an attempt to ease consumer concern the Japanese government promised to impose inspections on all this beef, and to buy the meat back when higher-than-permissible caesium levels were detected during the tests. The government planned to eventually pass on the buy-back costs to TEPCO.&lt;ref name="jaif58"/&gt; The same day the Japanese ministry of agriculture urged farmers and merchants to renounce the use and sale of compost made of manure from cows that may have been fed the contaminated straw. The measure also applied to humus from leaves fallen from trees. After developing guidelines for safety levels of radioactive caesium in compost and humus, this voluntary ban could be lifted.&lt;ref name="jaif59"/&gt;

On 28 July a ban was imposed on all the shipments on cattle from the prefecture [[Miyagi Prefecture|Miyagi]]. Some 1,031 beasts had been shipped that probably were fed with contaminated rice-straw. Measurements of 6 of them revealed 1,150 becquerels per kilogram, more than twice the governmental set safety level. Because the origins were scattered all over the prefecture, Miyagi became the second prefecture with a ban on all beef-cattle shipments. In the year before 11 March about 33,000 cattle were traded from Miyagi.&lt;ref name="jaif60"/&gt;

On 1 August a ban was put on all cattle in the prefecture [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]], after 6 cows from two villages were found with heavy levels of caesium. Iwate was the third prefecture where this was decided. Shipments of cattle and meat would only be allowed after examination, and when the level of caesium was below the regulatory standard. In Iwate some 36,000 cattle were produced in a year. All cattle would be checked for radioactive contamination before shipment, and the Japanese government asked the prefecture to temporarily reduce the number of shipments to match its inspection capability.&lt;ref name="jaif61"/&gt;

On 3 August, the prefecture [[Shimane Prefecture|Shimane]], in western Japan, conducted radiation checks on all beef cattle to ease consumer concerns about food safety. Starting from the second week of August all cattle were tested. Late July at one farm in this prefecture rice-straw was discovered with radioactive caesium levels exceeding the government safety guide. Although all other tests of beef cattle found far lower levels of radioactivity than the government standard, prices of beef from Shimane plummeted and wholesalers avoided all cattle from the prefecture. All processed beef would undergo preliminary screening, and meat registering 250 becquerels per kilogram or more of radioactive caesium – half the government safety level – would be tested further.&lt;ref name="jaif62"/&gt;

The second week of August the prefecture of [[Fukushima Prefecture]] initiated a buy-out of all cattle that could not be sold because the high levels of caesium in the meat. The prefecture decided to buy back all beef cattle that had become too old for shipment due to the shipping suspension in place since July.
On 2 August a group of farmers agreed with the Fukushima prefectural government to set up a consultative body to regulate this process. The prefectural government provided the subsidies needed. There was some delay, because the farmers and the local government could not agree about the prices.&lt;ref name=jaif110803/&gt;

The problems for the farmers were growing, because they did not know how to protect their cattle from contamination and did not know how to feed their cattle. The farmers said that the buy-back plan needed to be implemented immediately.&lt;ref name="jaif110803"/&gt;

On 5 August 2011, in response to calls for more support by farmers, the Japanese government revealed a plan to buy up all beef contaminated with radioactive caesium, that had already reached the distribution chains, as an additional measurement to support beef cattle farmers.
The plan included:
* the buy-out of about 3,500 head of cattle suspected to have been fed with contaminated rice straw, with caesium in excess of the safety limit.
* regardless the fact that some beef could be within the national safety limits.
* all this meat would be burned, to keep it out of distribution-channels
Other measurements were the expansion of subsidies to beef cattle farmers:
* Farmers who were unable to ship their cattle due to restrictions received 50,000 yen, (~ 630 dollars) per head of cattle regardless of the cattle's age.
* financial support was offered to prefectures that were buying up beef cattle, that had become too old to ship due to the ban.
* The Japanese Government planned to go on to buy all beef containing unsafe levels of radioactive caesium that reached the market through private organizations.&lt;ref name="jaif63"/&gt;

On 19 August 2011 was reported, the meat of 4 cows from one Fukushima farm had been found to be contaminated with radioactive caesium in excess of the government-set safety limits. The day after the meat of 5 other cows from this farm was also found to contain radioactive caesium. Because of this the central government delayed lifting a shipment ban on Fukushima beef. The 9 cows were among a total of over 200 head of cattle shipped from the farm and slaughtered at a facility in Yokohama city between 11 March nuclear accident and April. The beef had been stored by a food producer. The farmer denied feeding the cows contaminated rice straw, instead he used imported hay that had been stored at another farm.&lt;ref name="jaif64"/&gt;

Japan banned Fukushima beef. These domestic animals were affected by the food supply. It was reported that 136 cows consumed feed affected by radioactive caesium. A number of cows were found to have consumed rice straw containing high levels of radioactive caesium. This meat had already been distributed nationwide and that it "could have already reached consumers." They traced contaminated beef on farms near the Fukushima power plant, and on farms 100&amp;nbsp;km (70&amp;nbsp;miles) away. "The government has also acknowledged that the problem could be wider than just Fukushima." &lt;ref name="bbc110718"/&gt;

By August 2012, sampling of beef from affected areas revealed that 3 out of 58,460&lt;!---?? is this right?--&gt; beef samples contained radioactivity above regulatory limits. Much of the radioactivity is believed to have come from contaminated feed. Radioactivity infiltration into the beef supply has subsided with time, and is projected to continue decreasing.&lt;ref name="japantimes.co.jp"/&gt;

====Natto====
In August 2011, a group of 5 manufacturers of [[natto]], or fermented soybeans, in [[Mito, Ibaraki]] planned to seek damages from TEPCO because their sales had fallen by almost 50 percent. Natto is normally packed in rice-straw and after the discovery of caesium contamination, they had lost many customers. The lost sales from April–August 2011 had risen to around 1.3 million dollars.&lt;ref name="jaif65"/&gt;

====Tea-leaves====
On 3 September 2011 radioactive caesium exceeding the government's safety limit had been detected in tea leaves in Chiba and Saitama prefectures, near Tokyo. This was the ministry's first discovery of radioactive substances beyond legal limits since the tests of food stuffs started in August. These tests were conducted in order to verify local government data using different numbers and kinds of food samples. Tea leaves of one type of tea from Chiba Prefecture contained 2,720 becquerels of radioactive caesium per kilogram, 5 times above the legal safety limit. A maximum of 1,530 becquerels per kilogram was detected in 3 kinds of tea leaves from Saitama Prefecture. Investigations were done to find out where the tea was grown, and to determine how much tea had already made its way to market. Tea producers were asked to recall their products, when necessary.&lt;ref name="jaif66"/&gt; As tea leaves are never directly consumed, tea produced from processed leaves are expected to contain no more than 1/35th the density of caesium (in the case of 2720bq/kg, the tea will show just 77bq/l, below the 200bq/l legal limit at the time)&lt;ref name="kantei"/&gt;

In the prefecture [[Shizuoka Prefecture|Shizuoka]] at the beginning of April 2012, tests done on tea-leaves grown inside a greenhouse were found to contain less than 10 becquerels per kilogram, below the new limit of 100 becquerels,&lt;ref name="japanprobe.com"/&gt; The tests were done in a governmental laboratory in [[Kikugawa]] city, to probe caesium-concentrations before the at the end of April the tea-harvest season would start.&lt;ref name="mdn.mainichi.jp"/&gt;

The health ministry published in August 2012, that caesium levels in tea made from "yacon" leaves and in samples of Japanese tea "shot through the ceiling" this year.&lt;ref name="japtimes25Sep12"/&gt;

====Rice====
On 19 August radioactive caesium was found in a sample of rice. This was in Ibaraki Prefecture, just north of Tokyo, in a sample of rice from the city of Hokota, about 100&amp;nbsp;miles south of the nuclear plant. The prefecture said the radioactivity was well within safe levels: it measured 52 becquerels per kilogram, about one-tenth of the government-set limit for grains. Two other samples tested at the same time showed no contamination. The Agriculture Ministry said it was the first time that more than trace levels of caesium had been found in rice.&lt;ref name="nytimes67"/&gt;

On 16 September 2011 the results were published of the measurements of radioactive caesium in rice. The results were known of around 60 percent of all test-locations. Radioactive materials were detected in 94 locations, or 4.3 percent of the total. But the highest level detected so far, in Fukushima prefecture, was 136 becquerels per kilogram, about a quarter of the government's safety limit of 500 Becquerel per kilogram. Tests were conducted in 17 prefectures, and were completed in more than half of them. In 22 locations radioactive materials were detected in harvested rice. The highest level measured was 101.6 becquerels per kilogram, or one fifth of the safety limit. Shipments of rice did start in 15 prefectures, including all 52 municipalities in the prefecture [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]]. In Fukushima shipments of ordinary rice did start in 2 municipalities, and those of early-harvested rice in 20 municipalities.&lt;ref name="jaif68"/&gt;

On 23 September 2011 radioactive caesium in concentrations above the governmental safety limit was found in rice samples collected in an area in the northeastern part of the prefecture Fukushima. Rice-samples taken before the harvest showed 500 becquerels per kilogram in the city of Nihonmatsu. The Japanese government ordered a two way testing procedure of samples taken before and after the harvest. Pre-harvest tests were carried out in nine prefectures in the regions of [[Tohoku]] and [[Kantō region|Kanto]]. After the find of this high level of caesium, the prefectural government dis increase the number of places to be tested within the city from 38 to about 300. The city of [[Nihonmatsu]] held an emergency meeting on 24 September with officials from the prefecture government. The farmers, that already had started harvesting, were ordered to store their crop until the post-harvest tests were available.&lt;ref name="jaif69"/&gt;

On 16 November&lt;ref name="mainichi70"/&gt; 630 becquerels per kilogram of radioactive caesium was detected in rice harvested in the Oonami district in Fukushima City.&lt;ref name="nhk71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jaif72"/&gt;
All rice of the fields nearby was stored and none of this rice had been sold to the market. On 18 November all 154 farmers in the district were asked to suspend all shipments of rice. Tests were ordered on rice samples from all 154 farms in the district. The result of this testing was reported on 25 November: five more farms were found with caesium contaminated rice at a distance of 56&amp;nbsp;kilometers from the disaster reactors in the Oonami district of Fukushima City, The highest level of caesium detected was 1,270 becquerels per kilogram.&lt;ref name="nhk73"/&gt;

On 28 November 2011 the prefecture of Fukushima reported the find of caesium-contaminated rice, up to 1050 Becquerels per kilogram, in samples of 3 farms in the city [[Date, Fukushima|Date]] at a distance of 50&amp;nbsp;kilometers from the Fukushima Daiichi reactors. Some 9 kilo's of this crops were already sold locally before this date. Officials tried to find out who bought this rice. Because of this and earlier finds the government of the prefecture Fukushima decided to control more than 2300 farms in the whole district on caesium-contamination.&lt;ref name="nhk74"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jaif75"/&gt; A more precise number was mentioned by the Japanese newspaper [[The Mainichi Daily News]]: on 29 November orders were given to 2381 farms in [[Nihonmatsu]] and [[Motomiya]] to suspend part of their rice shipments. This number added to the already halted shipments at 1941 farms in 4 other districts including [[Date District, Fukushima|Date]], raised the total to 4322 farms.&lt;ref name="mainichi76"/&gt;

Rice exports from Japan to China became possible again after a bilateral governmental agreement in April 2012. With government-issued certificates of origin Japanese rice produced outside the prefectures [[Chiba prefecture|Chiba]], [[Fukushima prefecture]], [[Gunma prefecture|Gunma]], [[Ibaraki prefecture|Ibaraki]], [[Niigata prefecture|Niigata]], [[Nagano prefecture|Nagano]], [[Miyagi prefecture|Miyagi]], [[Saitama prefecture|Saitama]], [[Tokyo prefecture|Tokyo]], [[Tochigi prefecture|Tochigi]] and [[Saitama prefecture|Saitama]] was allowed to be exported. In the first shipment 140.000 tons of [[Hokkaido prefecture|Hokkaido]] rice of the 2011 harvest was sold to [[China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation]].&lt;ref name="mainichi77"/&gt;

====Noodles====
On 7 February 2012 noodles contaminated with radioactive caesium (258 becquerels of caesium per kilogram) were found in a restaurant in [[Okinawa]]. The noodles, called "Okinawa soba", were apparently produced with water filtered through contaminated ashes from wood originating from the prefecture Fukushima. On 10 February 2012 the Japanese Agency for Forestry set out a warning not to use ashes from wood or charcoal, even when the wood itself contained less than the governmental set maximum of 40 becquerels per kilo for wood or 280 becquerels for charcoal. When the standards were set, nobody thought about the use of the ashes to be used for the production of foods. But, in Japan it was a custom to use ashes when kneading noodles or to take away a bitter taste, or "aku" from "devil's tongue" and wild vegetables.&lt;ref name="mainichi78"/&gt;

====Mushrooms====
On 13 October 2011 the city of [[Yokohama]] terminated the use of dried shiitake-mushrooms in school lunches after tests had found radioactive caesium in them up to 350 becquerels per kilogram. In shiitake mushrooms grown outdoors on wood in a city in the prefecture [[Ibaraki Prefecture|Ibaraki]], 170&amp;nbsp;kilometers from the nuclear plant, samples contained 830 becquerels per kilogram of radioactive caesium, exceeding the government's limit of 500 becquerels. Radioactive contaminated shiitake mushrooms, above 500 becquerels per kilogram, were also found in two cities of prefecture [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]], therefore restrictions were imposed on the shipments from these cities.&lt;ref name="october"/&gt;

On 29 October the government of the prefecture [[Fukushima Prefecture]] announced that shiitake mushrooms grown indoors at a farm in [[Sōma District, Fukushima|Soma]], situated at the coast north from the Fukushima Daiichi plant, were contaminated with radioactive caesium: They contained 850 becquerels per kilogram, and exceeded the national safety-limit of 500-becquerel. The mushrooms were grown on beds made of woodchips mixed with other nutrients. The woodchips in the mushroom-beds sold by the agricultural cooperative of Soma were thought to have caused of the contamination. Since 24 October 2011 this farm had shipped 1,070 100-gram packages of shiitake mushrooms to nine supermarkets. Besides these no other shiitake mushrooms produced by the farm were sold to customers.&lt;ref name="mainichi79"/&gt;

In the city of [[Yokohama]] in March and October food was served to 800 people with dried [[shiitake]]-mushrooms that came from a farm near this town at a distance of 250&amp;nbsp;kilometer from Fukushima. The test-results of these mushrooms showed 2,770 Becquerels per kilo in March and 955 Becquerels per kilo in October, far above the limit of 500 Becquerels per kilo set by the Japanese government. The mushrooms were checked for contamination in the first week of November, after requests of concerned people with questions about possible contamination of the food served. No mushrooms were sold elsewhere.&lt;ref name="jaif80"/&gt;

On 10 November 2011 some 120&amp;nbsp;kilometers away southwest from the Fukushima-reactors in the prefecture [[Tochigi Prefecture|Tochigi]] 649 becquerels of radioactive cesium per kilogram was measured in [[kuritake]] mushrooms. Four other cities of Tochigi did already stop with the sales and shipments of the mushrooms grown there. The farmers were asked to stop all shipments and to call back the mushrooms already on the market.&lt;ref name="nhk81"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jaif82"/&gt;

====Drinking water====
The regulatory safe level for iodine-131 and caesium-137 in drinking water in Japan are 100&amp;nbsp;Bq/kg and 200&amp;nbsp;Bq/kg respectively.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt; The Japanese science ministry said on 20 March that radioactive substances were detected in [[tap water]] in Tokyo, as well as [[Tochigi Prefecture|Tochigi]], [[Gunma]], [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]] and [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]] prefectures.&lt;ref name="JapanTimes"/&gt; IAEA reported on 24 March that drinking water in Tokyo, Fukushima and Ibaraki had been above regulatory limits between 16 and 21 March.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt; On 26 March, IAEA reported that the values were now within legal limits.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt; On 23 March, Tokyo drinking water exceeded the safe level for infants, prompting the government to distribute bottled water to families with infants.&lt;ref name="BusinessWeek"/&gt; Measured levels were caused by [[iodine-131]] (I-131) and were 103, 137 and 174 Bq/l.&lt;ref name="WNN24a"/&gt; On 24 March, iodine-131 was detected in 12 of 47 prefectures, of which the level in Tochigi was the highest at 110&amp;nbsp;Bq/kg. Caesium-137 was detected in 6 prefectures but always below 10&amp;nbsp;Bq/kg.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt; On 25 March, tap water was reported to have reduced to 79&amp;nbsp;Bq/kg&lt;ref name=WNN24a/&gt; and to be safe for infants in Tokyo and Chiba but still exceeded limits in Hitachi and Tokaimura.&lt;ref name="CNN25"/&gt; On 27 April, "radiation in Tokyo's water supply fell to undetectable levels for the first time since 18 March."&lt;ref name="bloomberg"/&gt;

The following graphs show Iodine-131 water contaminations measured in water purifying plants From 16 March to 7 April:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

On 2 July samples of tapwater taken in Tokyo Shinjuku ward radioactive caesium-137 was detected for the first time since April. The concentration was 0.14 becquerel per kilogram and none was discovered yesterday, which compares with 0.21 becquerel on 22 April, according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Public Health. No caesium-134 or iodine-131 was detected. The level was below the safety limit set by the government. "This is unlikely to be the result of new radioactive materials being introduced, because no other elements were detected, especially the more sensitive iodine", into the water supply, were the comments of Hironobu Unesaki, a nuclear engineering professor at Kyoto University.&lt;ref name="sfgate"/&gt;

====Breast milk====
Small amounts of radioactive [[iodine]] were found in the [[breast milk]] of women living east of Tokyo. However, the levels were below the safety limits for tap water consumption by infants.&lt;ref name="Small amounts of radioactive iodine found in breast milk of 4 women"/&gt; Regulatory limits for infants in Japan are several levels of magnitude beneath what is known to potentially affect human health.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Radiation protection standards in Japan are currently stricter than international recommendations and the standards of most other states, including those in North America and Europe .&lt;ref name="japanprobe.com"/&gt; By Nov 2012, no radioactivity was detected in Fukushimas mothers breast milk. 100% of samples contained no detectable amount of radioactivity.&lt;ref name="asahi83"/&gt;&lt;ref name="greenaction-japan"/&gt;

====Baby-milk====
Mid November 2011 radioactive caesium was found in milk-powder for baby-food produced by the food company [[Meiji Dairies|Meiji Co.]] Although this firm was warned about this matter three times, the matter was taken seriously by its consumer service after it was approached by [[Kyodo News]]. Up to 30.8 becquerels per kilogram was found in Meiji Step milk powder. While this is under the governmental safety-limit of 200 becquerels per kilogram, this could be more harmful for young children. Because of this caesium-contaminated milk powder, the Japanese minister of health Yoko Komiyama said on 9 December 2011 at a press conference, that her ministry would start regularly tests on baby food products in connection with the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis, every three months and more frequently when necessary. Komiyama said: "As mothers and other consumers are very concerned (about radiation), we want to carry out regular tests", Test done by the government in July and August 2011 on 25 baby products did not reveal any contamination.&lt;ref name="mainichi84"/&gt;

====Children====
In a survey by the local and central governments conducted on 1,080 children aged 0 to 15 in Iwaki, Kawamata and Iitate on 26–30 March, almost 45 percent of these children had experienced [[thyroid]] exposure to radiation with radioactive [[iodine]], although in all cases the amounts of radiation did not warrant further examination, according to the [[Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission|Nuclear Safety Commission]] on Tuesday 5 July. In October 2011, [[hormone|hormonal]] irregularies in 10 evacuated children were reported. However, the organization responsible for the study said that no link had been established between the children's condition and exposure to radiation.&lt;ref name="Thyroid gland irregularities found in young evacuees from Fukushima"/&gt;

On 9 October a survey started in the prefecture Fukushima: ultrasonic examinations were done of the thyroid glands of all 360,000 children between 0 and 18 years of age. Follow-up tests will be done for the rest of their lives. This was done in response to concerned parents, alarmed by the evidence showing increased incidence of thyroid cancer among children after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. The project was done by the Medical University of Fukushima.&lt;ref name="archive85"/&gt; The results of the tests will be mailed to the children within a month. At the end of 2014 the initial testing of all children should be completed, after this the children will undergo a thyroid checkup every 2 years until they turn 20, and once every 5 years above that age.&lt;ref name="jaif86"/&gt;

In November 2011 in urine-samples of 1500 pre-school-children (ages 6 years or younger) from the city of [[Minamisoma]] in the prefecture Fukushima radioactive caesium was found in 104 cases. Most had levels between 20 and 30 becquerels per liter, just above the detection limit, but 187 becquerels was found in the urine of a one-year-old baby boy. The parents had been concerned about internal exposure. Local governments covered the tests for elementary schoolchildren and older students. According to RHC JAPAN a medical consultancy firm in Tokyo, these levels could not harm the health of the children. But director Makoto Akashi of the National Institute of Radiological Sciences said, that although those test results should be verified, this still proved the possibility of internal exposure in the children of Fukushima, but that the internal exposure would not increase, when all food was tested for radioactivity before consumption.&lt;ref name="nhk87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jaif88"/&gt;

====Soil====
Also in July citizens groups reported that a survey of soil at four places in the city of Fukushima taken on 26 June proved that all samples were contaminated with radioactive caesium, measuring 16,000 to 46,000 becquerels per kilogram and exceeding the legal limit of 10,000 becquerels per kg,&lt;ref name="archive89"/&gt; A study published by the [[PNAS]] found that [[caesium 137]] had "strongly contaminated the soils in large areas of eastern and northeastern Japan."&lt;ref name="DoipnasMissing" /&gt;

====Wildlife====
{{unreliable sources|date=September 2016}}
After the find of 8,000 [[becquerel]]s of [[caesium]] per kilogram in wild [[mushroom]]s, and a [[wild boar]] that was found with radioactivity amounts about 6 times the safety limit, Professor Yasuyuki Muramatsu at the [[Gakushuin University]] urged detailed checks on wild plants and animals. Radioactive caesium in soil and fallen leaves in forests in his opinion would be easily absorbed by mushrooms and edible plants. He said that wild animals like boars were bound to accumulate high levels of radioactivity by eating contaminated mushrooms and plants. The professor added that detailed studies were
on wild plants and animals. Across Europe the [[Chernobyl]]-incident had likewise effects on wild fauna and flora.&lt;ref name="jaif90"/&gt;

The first study of the effects of radioactive contamination following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster suggested, through standard point count censuses that the abundance of birds was negatively correlated with radioactive contamination, and that among the 14 species in common between the Fukushima and the Chernobyl regions, the decline in abundance was presently steeper in Fukushima.&lt;ref name="Abundance of birds in Fukushima as judged from Chernobyl"/&gt; However criticism of this conclusion is that naturally there would be less bird species living on a smaller amount of land, that is, in the most contaminated areas, than the number one would find living in a larger body of land, that is, in the broader area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atomicinsights.com/critical-analysis-mousseau-fukushima-presentation/ Critical Analysis of Mousseau Fukushima Presentation, 22 March 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists in [[Alaska]] are testing [[Pinniped|seal]]s struck with an unknown illness to see if it is connected to radiation from Fukushima.&lt;ref name="Scientists test sick Alaska seals for radiation - Technology &amp; science - Science - msnbc.com"/&gt;


About a year after the nuclear disaster some Japanese scientists found what they regarded was an increased number of mutated butterflies. In their paper, they said, this was an unexpected finding, as "insects are very resistant to radiation." Since these are recent findings, the study suggests that these mutations have been passed down from older generations.&lt;ref name="Report: Mutated butterflies found near Fukushima"/&gt; Timothy Jorgensen, of the Department of Radiation Medicine and the Health Physics Program of [[Georgetown University]] raised a number of issues with this "simply not credible" paper, in the journal ''Nature'' and concluded that the team's paper is "highly suspect due to both their internal inconsistencies and their incompatibility with earlier and more comprehensive radiation biology research on insects".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/articles/srep00570?WT.ec_id=SREP-20120814 The biological impacts of the Fukushima nuclear accident on the pale grass blue butterfly]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plankton====
Radioactive caesium was found in high concentration in plankton in the sea near the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Samples were taken up to 60&amp;nbsp;kilometers from the coast of [[Iwaki, Fukushima|Iwaki]] city in July 2011 by scientists of the [[Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology]]. Up to 669 becquerels per kilogram of radioactive caesium was measured in samples of animal plankton taken 3&amp;nbsp;kilometers offshore. The leader of the research-group Professor Takashi Ishimaru, said that the sea current continuously carried contaminated water southwards from the plant. Further studies to determine the effect on the food-chain and fish would be needed.&lt;ref name="jaif91"/&gt;

====Building materials====
Detectable levels of radiation were found in an apartment building in [[Nihonmatsu, Fukushima]], where the foundation was made using concrete containing crushed stone collected from a quarry near the troubled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, situated inside the evacuation-zone. Of the 12 households living there were 10 households relocated after the quake.&lt;ref name="mainichi92"/&gt; After inspection at the quarry – situated inside the evacuation-zone around the nuclear plant—in the town of [[Namie, Fukushima]] between 11 and 40 microsieverts of radiation per hour were detected one meter above gravel held at eight storage sites in the open, while 16 to 21 microsieverts were detected in three locations covered by roofs. From this place about 5,200 metric tons of gravel was shipped from this place and used as building material. On 21 January 2012 the association of quarry agents in the prefecture Fukushima asked its members to voluntarily check their products for radioactivity to ease public concerns over radioactive contamination of building materials.&lt;ref name="mainichi93"/&gt; The minister of Industry Yukio Edano did instruct TEPCO to pay compensation for the economical damages. Raised radiation levels were found on many buildings constructed after the quake.&lt;ref name="mainichi94"/&gt; Schools, private houses, roads. Because of the public anger raised by these finds. the government of [[Nihonmatsu, Fukushima]] decided to examine all 224 city construction projects started after the quake.&lt;ref name="mainichi95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jaif96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jaif97"/&gt; Some 200 construction companies received stone from the Namie-quarry, and the material was used in at least 1000 building-sites. The contaminated stone was found in some 49 houses and apartments. Radiation levels of 0.8 mSv per hour were found, almost as high as the radiation levels outside the homes.&lt;ref name="jaif98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nhk99"/&gt; None of these represents a potential danger to human health.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

On 22 January 2012, the Japanese government survey had identified around 60 houses built with the radioactive contaminated concrete. Even after 12 April 2011, when the area was declared to be an evacuation zone, the shipments continued, and the stone was used for building purposes.&lt;ref name="mainichi100"/&gt;

In the first weeks of February 2012 up to 214,200 becquerels of radioactive caesium per kilogram was measured in samples gravel in the quarry near Namie, situated inside the evacuation zone. The gravel stored outside showed about 60,000–210,000 becquerels of caesium in most samples. From the 25 quarries in the evacuation zones, up to 122,400 becquerels of radioactive caesium was found at one that has been closed since the nuclear crisis broke out on 11 March 2011. In one quarry, that is still operational 5,170 becquerels per kilogram was found. Inspections were done at some 150 of the 1.100 construction sites, where the gravel form the Namie-quarry was suspected to be used. At 27 locations the radioactivity levels were higher than the surrounding area.&lt;ref name="mainichi101"/&gt;

===Hot spots at school-yards===
On 6 May 2012 it became known that according to documents of the municipal education board reports submitted by each school in Fukushima prefecture in April at least 14 elementary schools, 7 junior high and 5 nursery schools so called "hot spots" existed, where the radiation exposure was more than 3.8 microsieverts per hour, resulting in an annual cumulative dose above 20 millisieverts. However all restrictions, that limited the maximum time to three hours for the children to play outside at the playgrounds of the schools, were lifted at the beginning of the new academic year in April by the education board. The documents were obtained by a group of civilians after a formal request to disclose the information. Tokiko Noguchi, the foreman of a group of civilians, insisted that the education board would restore the restrictions.&lt;ref name="mainichi102"/&gt;

====New radioactivity limits for food in Japan====
On 22 December 2011 the Japanese government announced new limits for radioactive caesium in food. The new norms would be enforced in April 2012.&lt;ref name="New radiation limits alarm local entities"/&gt;

{| style="margin-left:40px;"
|-
| '''food''' || '''new norm''' || '''old limit'''
|-
| rice, meat, vegetables, fish|| 100 becquerel per kilogram|| 500 becquerel per kilogram
|-
| milk, milk-powder, infant-food || 50 becquerel per kilogram || 200 becquerel per kilogram
|-
| drinking water || 10 becquerel per liter || 200 becquerel per liter
|}

On 31 March 2012 the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan published a report on radioactive caesium found in food. Between January and around 15 March 2012 at 421 occasions food was found containing more than 100 becquerels per kilogram caesium. All was found within 8 prefectures: [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]], [[Fukushima Prefecture]] (285 finds), [[Gunma Prefecture|Gunma]], [[Ibaraki prefecture|Ibaraki]] (36 finds), [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]], [[Miyagi Prefecture|Miyagi]], [[Tochigi Prefecture|Tochigi]] (29 finds) and [[Yamagata prefecture|Yamagata]]. Most times it involved fish: landlocked salmon and flounder, seafood, after this: Shiitake-mushrooms or the meat of wild animals.&lt;ref name="mainichi103"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nhk104"/&gt;

In the first week of April 2012 caesium-contamination above legal limits was found in:
* Shiitake mushrooms in [[Manazuru]] [[Kanagawa prefecture]] situated at 300&amp;nbsp;kilometers from Fukushima: 141 becquerels/kg
* bamboo-shoots in two cities in [[Chiba prefecture]]
* bamboo-shoots and Shiitake-mushrooms in 5 cities in the region [[Kantō region|Kantō]], [[Ibaraki prefecture]]
In [[Gunma]] prefecture 106 becquerels/kg was found in beef. Sharper limits for meat would be taken effect in October 2012, but in order to ease consumer concern the farmers were asked to refrain from shipping.&lt;ref name="jaif105"/&gt;

==Decontamination efforts==
In the last week of August Prime Minister Naoto Kan informed the Governor of Fukushima Prefecture about the plans to build a central storage facility to store and treat nuclear waste including contaminated soil in Fukushima. On 27 August at a meeting in Fukushima City Governor Yuhei Sato spoke out his concern about the sudden proposals, and the implications that this would have for the prefecture and its inhabitants, that had already endured so much from the nuclear accident. Kan said, that the government had no intention to make the plant a final facility, but the request was needed in order to make a start with decontamination.&lt;ref name="jaif106"/&gt;

==Distribution outside Japan==

Radioactivity from the disaster was found in [[kelp]] off of [[Coastal California]].&lt;ref name="scientificamerican"/&gt;

According to a Professor at Stanford, there were some meteorological effects involved and that "81 percent of all the emissions were deposited over the ocean" instead of mainly being spread inland.&lt;ref name="Jason Gale"/&gt;

===Distribution by sea===
Seawater containing measurable levels of iodine-131 and caesium-137 were collected by Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) on 22–23 March at several points 30&amp;nbsp;km from the coastline iodine concentrations were "at or above Japanese regulatory limits" while caesium was "well below those limits" according to an IAEA report on 24 March.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt; On 25 March, IAEA indicated that in the long term, caesium-137 (with a half-life of 30 years) would be the most relevant isotope as far as doses was concerned and indicated the possibility "to follow this nuclide over long distances for several years." The organization also said it could take months or years for the isotope to reach "other shores of the Pacific".&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt;

The survey by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) reveals that radioactive caesium released from Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant reached the ocean 2000&amp;nbsp;kilometers from the plant and 5000&amp;nbsp;meters deep one month after the accident. It is considered that airborne caesium particles fell on the ocean surface, and sank as they were attached to the bodies of dead plankton. The survey result was announced in a symposium held on 20 November in Tokyo. From 18 to 30 April, JAMSTEC collected "marine snow", sub-millimeter particles made mostly of dead plankton and sand, off the coast of Kamchatka Peninsula, 2000&amp;nbsp;kilometers away from Fukushima, and off the coast of Ogasawara Islands, 1000&amp;nbsp;kilometers away, at 5000&amp;nbsp;meters below the ocean surface. The Agency detected radioactive caesium in both locations, and from the ratio of caesium-137 and caesium-134 and other observations it was determined that it was from Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant. The density of radioactive caesium is still being analyzed, according to the Agency. It has been thus confirmed that radioactive materials in the ocean are moving and spreading not just by ocean currents but by various other means.

===Distribution by air===
[[File:Fukushima trajectory animation for days 10 to 21 after the accident.gif|thumb|File:Fukushima trajectory animation for days 10 to 21 after the accident]]
The United Nations predicted that the initial radioactivity [[Plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] from the stricken Japanese reactors would reach the United States by 18 March. Health and nuclear experts emphasized that radioactivity in the plume would be diluted as it traveled and, at worst, would have extremely minor health consequences in the United States.&lt;ref name="nytimes107"/&gt; A simulation by the Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy indicated that trace amounts of radioactivity would reach California and Mexico around 19 March.&lt;ref name="Nouvelle simulation du nuage de pollution radioactive au Japon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aktuelle Informationen"/&gt; These predictions were tested by a worldwide network of highly sensitive radiative isotope measuring equipment, with the resulting data used to assess any potential impact to human health as well as the status of the reactors in Japan.&lt;ref name="nytimes108"/&gt;&lt;ref name="epa"/&gt; Consequently, by 18 March [[Nuclear fallout|radioactive fallout]] including isotopes of iodine-131, iodine-132, tellurium-132, iodine-133, caesium-134 and caesium-137 was detected in air filters at the University of Washington, [[Seattle]], USA.&lt;ref name="Fission Products in Seattle Reveal Clues about Japan Nuclear Disaster"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arrival time and magnitude of airborne fission products from the Fukushima, Japan, reactor incident as measured in Seattle, Washington, USA"/&gt;

Due to an [[anticyclone]] south of Japan{{Verify source|date=May 2011}}, favorable westerly winds were dominant during most of the first week of the accident, depositing most of the radioactive material out to sea and away from population centers, with some unfavorable wind directions depositing radioactive material over Tokyo. [[Low-pressure area]] over Eastern Japan gave less favorable wind directions 21–22 March. Wind shift to north takes place Tuesday midnight. After the shift, the plume would again be pushed out to the sea for the next becoming days.{{Clarify|date=May 2011}} Roughly similar prediction results are presented for the next 36&amp;nbsp;hours by the Finnish Meteorological Institute.&lt;ref name="Forecast of air movement"/&gt; In spite of winds blowing towards Tokyo during 21–22 March, he{{Who|date=May 2011}} comments, "From what I've been able to gather from official reports of radioactivity releases from the Fukushima plant, Tokyo will not receive levels of radiation dangerous to human health in the coming days, should emissions continue at current levels."{{cite quote|date=May 2011}}

[[Norwegian Institute for Air Research]] have continuous forecasts of the radioactive cloud and its movement.&lt;ref name="Fukushima – Atmospheric Transport"/&gt; These are based on the [[FLEXPART]] model, originally designed for forecasting the spread of radioactivity from the [[Chernobyl disaster]].

As of 28 April, the Washington State Department of Health, located in the U.S state closest to Japan, reported that levels of radioactive material from the Fukushima plant had dropped significantly, and were now often below levels that could be detected with standard tests.&lt;ref name="doh"/&gt;

==Response in other countries==
{{see also|International reaction to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster}}

===Rush for iodine===
[[File:IodineDistJapan.jpg|thumb|right|Packaged potassium iodide tablets.]]
Fear of radiation from Japan prompted a global rush for iodine pills, including in the United States,&lt;ref name="Amid Japan nuclear drama, Bay Area potassium iodide sales skyrocket"/&gt; Canada, Russia,&lt;ref name="Radiation fears spark rush for iodine pills"/&gt; Korea,&lt;ref name="South Korean radiation fear iodine rush"/&gt; China,&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"/&gt; Malaysia&lt;ref name="heraldsun1"/&gt; and Finland.&lt;ref name="helsinginsanomat"/&gt; There is a rush for iodized salt in China.&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"/&gt; A rush for iodine antiseptic solution appeared in Malaysia.

The isotope [[iodine-131]] is easily absorbed by the [[thyroid]]. Persons exposed to releases of I-131 from any source have a higher risk for developing [[thyroid cancer]] or thyroid disease, or both. Iodine-131 has a short [[half-life]] at approximately 8 days, and therefore is an issue mostly in the first weeks after the incident. Children are more vulnerable to I-131 than adults. Increased risk for thyroid [[neoplasm]] remains elevated for at least 40 years after exposure. [[Potassium iodide]] tablets prevent iodine-131 absorption by saturating the thyroid with non-radioactive iodine.&lt;ref name="Atsdr1"/&gt; Japan's Nuclear Safety Commission recommended local authorities to instruct evacuees leaving the 20-kilometre area to ingest stable (not radioactive) iodine.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt; [[CBS News]] reported that the number of doses of potassium iodide available to the public in Japan was inadequate to meet the perceived needs for an extensive radioactive contamination event.&lt;ref name="cbs3"/&gt;

[[Caesium-137]] is also a particular threat because it behaves like [[potassium]] and is taken up by cells throughout the body. Additionally, it has a long, 30-year half-life. Cs-137 can cause acute [[radiation sickness]], and increase the risk for cancer because of exposure to high-energy gamma radiation. Internal exposure to Cs-137, through ingestion or inhalation, allows the radioactive material to be distributed in the soft tissues, especially muscle tissue, exposing these tissues to the beta particles and gamma radiation and increasing cancer risk.&lt;ref name="CDC1"/&gt; [[Prussian blue]] helps the body excrete caesium-137.&lt;ref name=cbs3/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atsdr2"/&gt;

[[Strontium-90]] behaves like [[calcium]], and tends to deposit in bone and blood-forming tissue (bone marrow). 20–30% of ingested Sr-90 is absorbed and deposited in the bone. Internal exposure to Sr-90 is linked to bone cancer, cancer of the soft tissue near the bone, and leukemia.&lt;ref name="epa1"/&gt; Risk of cancer increases with increased exposure to Sr-90.&lt;ref name="epa1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

[[Plutonium]] is also present in the [[MOX fuel]] of the Unit 3 reactor and in spent fuel rods.&lt;ref name="cnet"/&gt; Officials at the International Atomic Energy Agency say the presence of MOX fuel does not add significantly to the dangers. [[Plutonium-239]] is long-lived and potentially toxic with a half-life of 24,000 years. Some hazardous for tens of thousands of years.&lt;ref name="npr1"/&gt; Radioactive products with long half-lives release less radioactivity per unit time than products with a short half life, as isotopes with a longer half life emit particles much less frequently. For example, one mole (131 grams) of &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I releases 6x10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; decays 99.9% of them within three months, whilst one mole (238 grams) of &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U releases 6x10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; decays 99.9% of them within 45 billion years, but only about 40 parts per trillion in the first three months. Experts commented that the long-term risk associated with [[Plutonium#Toxicity|plutonium toxicity]] is "highly dependent on the [[geochemistry]] of the particular site."&lt;ref name="Japan lacking radioactive water storage: US experts"/&gt;

==Summarised daily events==
{{see also|Timeline of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster}}

[[File:Fukushima Dosis qtl1 en.svg|thumb|right|Radiation dose rates during ventings, hydrogen explosions and fires at Fukushima]]
* On 11 March, Japanese authorities reported that there had been no "release of radiation" from any of the power plants.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2015}}
* On 12 March, the day after the earthquake, increased levels of iodine-131 and caesium-137 were reported near Unit 1 on the plant site.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt;
* On 13 March, venting to release pressure started at several reactors resulting in the release of radioactive material.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt;
* From 12 to 15 March the people of Namie were evacuated by the local officials to a place in the north of the town. This may have been in an area directly affected by a cloud of radioactive materials from the plants. There are conflicting reports about whether or not the government knew at the time the extent of the danger, or even how much danger there was.&lt;ref name="volkskrant109"/&gt;
* [[Chief Cabinet Secretary]] [[Yukio Edano]] announced on 15 March 2011 that radiation dose rates had been measured as high as 30&amp;nbsp;mSv/h on the site of the plant between units 2 and 3, as high as 400&amp;nbsp;[[millisievert|mSv]]/h&lt;ref name="400_mSv"/&gt; near unit 3, between it and unit 4, and 100&amp;nbsp;mSv/h near unit 4. He said, "there is no doubt that unlike in the past, the figures are the level at which human health can be affected."&lt;ref name="ABC1"/&gt; Prime Minister [[Naoto Kan]] urged people living between 20 and 30&amp;nbsp;kilometers of the plant to stay indoors, "The danger of further radiation leaks (from the plant) is increasing", Kan warned the public at a press conference, while asking people to "act calmly".&lt;ref name="KN1"/&gt; A spokesman for Japan's nuclear safety agency said TEPCO had told it that radiation levels in Ibaraki, between Fukushima and Tokyo, had risen but did not pose a health risk. Edano reported that the average radiation dose rate over the whole day was 0.109&amp;nbsp;μSv/h.&lt;ref name="eiken, radiation" /&gt; 23 out of 150 tested persons living close to the plant were decontaminated&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt;
* On 16 March power plant staff were briefly evacuated after smoke rose above the plant and radiation levels measured at the gate increased to 10&amp;nbsp;mSv/h.&lt;ref name="Press release"/&gt; Media reported 1,000&amp;nbsp;mSv/h close to the leaking reactor,{{Clarify|date=March 2011}} with radiation levels subsequently dropping back to 800–600&amp;nbsp;mSv.&lt;ref name="cbs1"/&gt; Japan's defence ministry criticized the nuclear-safety agency and TEPCO after some of its troops were possibly exposed to radiation when working on the site.&lt;ref name="ABC16"/&gt; [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Japan's ministry of science]] (MEXT) measured radiation levels of up to 0.33&amp;nbsp;mSv/h 20&amp;nbsp;kilometers northwest of the power plant.&lt;ref name="NHK16"/&gt; Japan's Nuclear Safety Commission recommended local authorities to instruct evacuees leaving the 20-kilometre area to ingest stable (not radioactive) iodine.&lt;ref name="IAEAiodine"/&gt;
* On 17 March IAEA radiation monitoring over 47 cities showed that levels of radiation in Tokyo had not risen. Although at some locations around 30&amp;nbsp;km from the Fukushima plant, the dose rates had risen significantly in the preceding 24&amp;nbsp;hours (in one location from 80 to 170&amp;nbsp;μSv/h and in another from 26 to 95&amp;nbsp;μSv/h), levels varied according to the direction from the plant.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt; Spinach grown in open air around 75&amp;nbsp;kilometers south of the nuclear plant had elevated levels of radioactive iodine and caesium&lt;ref name="spinach"/&gt;
* On 18 March IAEA clarified that, contrary to several news reports, the IAEA had not received any notification from the Japanese authorities of people sickened by radiation contamination.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt;
* On 19 March MEXT said a trace amount of radioactive substances was detected in [[tap water]] in Tokyo, as well as [[Tochigi Prefecture|Tochigi]], [[Gunma]], [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]] and [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]] prefectures.&lt;ref name=JapanTimes/&gt; The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced that radioactivity levels exceeding legal limits had been detected in milk produced in the Fukushima area and in certain vegetables in Ibaraki. Measurements made by Japan in a number of locations have shown the presence of [[radionuclide]]s such as [[iodine-131]] (I-131) and [[caesium-137]] (Cs-137) on the ground.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt;
* On 23 March, MEXT released new environmental data.&lt;ref name="Readings of environmental monitoring samples"/&gt; Radioactivity readings for soil and pond samples were highest at one location 40&amp;nbsp;km northwest of the plant. On 19 March, upland soil there contained 28.1&amp;nbsp;[[Becquerel|kBq]]/kg of Cs-137 and 300&amp;nbsp;kBq/kg of I-131. One day later, these same figures were 163&amp;nbsp;kBq/kg of Cs-137 and 1,170&amp;nbsp;kBq/kg of I-131. Cs-137 of 163&amp;nbsp;kBq/kg is equal to 3,260&amp;nbsp;kBq/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
* On 24 March, three workers were exposed to high levels of radiation which caused two of them to require hospital treatment after radioactive water seeped through their protective clothes while working in unit 3.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; It rained in Tokyo from the morning of 21 March&lt;ref name="jma1"/&gt; to 24 March.&lt;ref name="jma1110"/&gt; The rain brought radioactive fallout there. In [[Shinjuku, Tokyo|Shinjuku]], based on the research by [[Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Public Health]], 83900 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of I-131, 6310 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of Cs-134, and 6350 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of Cs-137 were detected for these four days in total as radioactive fallout, including 24&amp;nbsp;hours from 20 March 9:00&amp;nbsp;am to 21 March 9:00&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref name="tokyo-eiken"/&gt;
* On 25 March the German [[Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety|Ministry of the Environment]] announced that small amounts of radioactive iodine had been observed in three places within the German atmosphere.&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt;
* On 26 March, Japan's nuclear safety agency said that contamination from iodine-131 in seawater near the discharge had increased to 1,850 times the limit.&lt;ref name="Reuters26"/&gt;
* 27 March: Levels of "over 1000" (the upper limit of the measuring device)&lt;ref name="At Japanese Nuclear Plant, a Choice Between Bad, Worse"/&gt; and 750&amp;nbsp;mSv/h were reported from water within unit 2 (but outside the containment structure) and 3 respectively. A statement that this level was "ten million times the normal level" in unit 2 was later retracted and attributed to [[iodine-134]] rather than to a longer-lived element.&lt;ref name="TEPCO28"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WNN27"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Officials retract reports of extremely high radiation at Fukushima plant"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Officials: Big spike at Japan nuke plant an error"/&gt; Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency indicated that "The level of radiation is greater than 1,000 millisieverts. It is certain that it comes from atomic fission [...]. But we are not sure how it came from the reactor."&lt;ref name="Radioactive pools block reactor repairs: 1 sievert readings in No. 2 signal fission under way"/&gt;
* 29 March: iodine-131 levels in seawater 330m south of a key discharge outlet had reached 138&amp;nbsp;Bq/ml (3,355 times the legal limit)&lt;ref name="asahi.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="www3.nhk.or.jp"/&gt;
* 30 March: iodine-131 concentrations in seawater had reached 180&amp;nbsp;Bq/ml at a location 330m south of a plant discharge, 4,385 times the legal limit.&lt;ref name="www3.nhk.or.jp"/&gt; Tests indicating 3.7&amp;nbsp;MBq/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of Cs-137 caused the IAEA to state that its criteria for evacuation were exceeded in the village of [[Iitate, Fukushima]], outside the existing {{convert|30|km|miles|abbr=off}} radiation exclusion zone.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IAEA Confirms Very High Levels of Contamination Far From Reactors"/&gt;
* On 31 March, IAEA corrected the value of iodine-131 that had been detected in the [[Iitate]] village to 20&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="nikkei"/&gt; The value that had been announced at a press interview was about 2&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="High radiation found outside no-go zone"/&gt;
* On 1 April, besides leafy vegetables and parsley, also beef with iodine-131 and/or caesium-134 and caesium-137 levels above the regulatory limit was reported.&lt;ref name=IAEAiodine/&gt;
* 3 April: Health officials reported radioactive substances higher than the legal limits were found in [[mushroom]]s.&lt;ref name="kyodonews"/&gt; The Japanese government publicly stated that it expected ongoing radioactive-material releases for "months" assuming normal containment measures were used.&lt;ref name="kyodonews111"/&gt;
* 4 to 10 April TEPCO announced it had begun dumping 9,100 tons of water that was 100 times the contamination limit from a wastewater treatment plant, and dumping would take 6 days.&lt;ref name="Japan to dump 11,500 metric tons of radioactive water"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kyodonews112"/&gt;
* 5 April: Fish caught 50&amp;nbsp;miles off the coast of Japan had radioactivity exceeding safe levels.&lt;ref name="Radioactive fish caught off Japanese coast"/&gt;
* 15 April: Iodine-131 in seawater was measured at 6,500 times the legal limit, while levels of caesium-134 and caesium-137 rose nearly fourfold, possibly due to installation of steel plates meant to reduce the possibility of water leaking into the ocean.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;
* 18 April: High levels of radioactive strontium-90 were discovered in soil at the plant, prompting the government to begin regularly testing for the element.&lt;ref name="NHKStrontium"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TEPCOStrontium"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TEPCOStrontiumSea"/&gt;
* 22 April: The Japanese government asked residents to leave Iitate and four other villages within a month due to radiation levels.&lt;ref name="AP-20110608"/&gt;

The density is 160,000 times that of the legal limit for release into the ocean, and it is about 1,000 times that of the highest density in the groundwater that had been measured so far (5,100 Bq/L). TEPCO didn't disclose the result of measurement of strontium alone, as the company believed there was a possibility that the result of measurement was wrong. As to this particular sample, TEPCO had announced on July last year that the sample had contained 900,000 Bq/L of all-beta including strontium. On February 6, TEPCO explained that they had "underestimated all of the results of high-density all-beta, which exceeded the upper limit of measurement." This particular sample may contain about 10 million Bq/L of all-beta, according to TEPCO. The company recently switched to a different method of analysis that uses diluted samples when the density of radioactive materials is high.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Namie-Odaka Nuclear Power Plant'''|浪江・小高原子力発電所|Namie Odaka genshiryoku hatsudensho}} was a planned [[nuclear power]] plant in [[Minamisōma, Fukushima|Minamisōma]] and [[Namie, Fukushima|Namie]] in the [[Fukushima Prefecture]], Japan.   It was a project of the [[Tōhoku Electric Power Company]]. Preliminary ground work had been completed by the time of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]].  The plans were canceled after urging from local lawmakers in the wake of the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] and due to strong local opposition.&lt;ref&gt;NucNet.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kodansha USA|Kodansha Comics USA]] published an English-language edition as a single volume on March 7, 2017, close to the sixth anniversary of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] that precipitated the disaster.

The series was widely read and discussed in Japan as one of the only pieces of reliable reporting from inside the cleanup site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Referring to his work in the Japanese subtitle as a "record of labor," Tatsuta describes the daily lives of workers at the site down to small details, such as how itchy their noses would become after hours under protective masks. (That chapter, titled "Itchy Nose", was republished in the March 2017 issue of [[Harper's Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|accessdate= December 24, 2018
}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Other notable details include a description of the multi-layered subcontracting system employed by [[TEPCO]] to hire cleanup workers. The unnamed company that Tatsuta worked for is a sixth subcontractor of TEPCO, and after all the intermediaries took their cuts, his salary was only 8,000 yen per day, rising to 20,000 yen on days when he was called upon to enter the reactor buildings.&lt;ref name="JapanTimes Iizuka"&gt;{{cite news

Neither the manga nor Tatsuta have posed an answer to whether Japanese nuclear power plants should be closed. When [[Kyodo News]] asked why Tatsuta wrote the series, he said, "I wanted to describe the gap between what the public thought and what I saw inside. 'Ichiefu' is...like my diary, but I am pleased if it has resulted in showing the workers' real lives."&lt;ref name="JapanTimes Iizuka"/&gt;

On 5 July 2012, the [[National Diet of Japan Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission]] (NAIIC) found that the causes of the accident had been foreseeable, and that the plant operator, [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]] (TEPCO), had failed to meet basic safety requirements such as risk assessment, preparing for containing collateral damage, and developing [[emergency evacuation|evacuation plans]]. On 12 October 2012, [[Timeline of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster#12 October|TEPCO admitted for the first time]] that it had failed to take necessary measures for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants.&lt;ref name="NYT20121012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fukushima operator must learn from mistakes, new adviser says"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi20121012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN20121012"/&gt;

==Overview==
The [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]] comprised six separate [[boiling water reactor]]s originally designed by [[General Electric]] (GE) and maintained by the [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]] (TEPCO). At the time of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake]] on 11 March 2011, Reactors [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant#Nuclear disaster of March 2011|4, 5, and 6]] were [[shutdown (nuclear reactor)|shut down]] in preparation for [[Refueling and overhaul|re-fueling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Black, Richard |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12745186 |title= Reactor breach worsens prospects |work=BBC Online |date=15 March 2011 |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their [[spent fuel pool]]s still required cooling.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607091828/http://www.iaea.org/press/?p=1463|title=Japanese Earthquake Update (19 March 2011, 4:30 UTC) : IAEA Alert Log: Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident|date=7 June 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20170226171624/http://www.jsmillerdesign.com/FukushimaPapers/Fukuchima_AREVA.pdf Accident Progression.&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the earthquake, the electricity-producing Reactors 1, 2, and 3 automatically shut down their sustained [[fission reaction]]s by inserting [[control rod]]s in a legally-mandated safety procedure referred to as a [[SCRAM]], which ends the reactors' normal running conditions. As the reactors were unable to generate power to run their own coolant pumps, emergency diesel generators came online, as designed, to power electronics and coolant systems. These operated nominally until the tsunami destroyed the generators for Reactors 1–5. The two generators cooling Reactor 6 were undamaged and were sufficient to be pressed into service to cool the neighboring Reactor 5 along with their own reactor, averting the overheating issues the other reactors suffered.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

The largest tsunami wave was {{Convert|13|m|ft|sp=us}} high and hit 50 minutes after the initial earthquake, overwhelming the plant's [[seawall]], which was {{Convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}} high.&lt;ref name=":182"&gt;

These pumps were needed to continuously circulate coolant water through the [[Generation II reactor]]s for several days to keep the [[fuel rod]]s from melting, as the fuel rods continued to generate [[decay heat]] after the [[Scram|SCRAM]] event. The fuel rods would become hot enough to melt during the fuel decay time period if an adequate [[thermal reservoir|heat sink]] was not available. After the secondary emergency pumps (run by back-up electrical [[battery (electricity)|batteries]]) ran out, one day after the tsunami on 12 March,&lt;ref name="oecd-nea.org"/&gt; the water pumps stopped and the [[decay heat#Power reactors in shutdown|reactors began to overheat]].

As workers struggled to supply power to the reactors' coolant systems and restore power to their [[control room]]s, a number of [[hydrogen explosion|hydrogen-air]] chemical explosions occurred, the first in Unit 1 on 12 March, and the last in Unit 4, on 15 March.&lt;ref name="oecd-nea.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IAEA15March"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyer.eu/news/regional-news/hydrogen-in-nuclear-accidents-what-is-the-role-of-the-gas-in-fukushima Hydrogen explosions Fukushima nuclear plant: what happened?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235552/http://www.hyer.eu/news/regional-news/hydrogen-in-nuclear-accidents-what-is-the-role-of-the-gas-in-fukushima |date=2 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that the hot [[zirconium alloy#Oxidation of zirconium by steam|zirconium fuel cladding-water reaction]] in Reactors 1–3 produced 800 to 1000 kilograms of hydrogen gas each. The pressurized gas was vented out of the [[reactor pressure vessel]] where it mixed with the ambient air, and eventually reached [[flammability limit|explosive concentration limits]] in Units 1 and 3. Due to piping connections between Units 3 and 4, or alternatively from the same reaction occurring in the [[spent fuel pool]] in Unit 4 itself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.ornl.gov/sites/publications/Files/Pub33574.pdf |title=MELCOR Model of the Spent Fuel Pool of Fukushima Dai-ichi Unit 4 |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305111907/http://info.ornl.gov/sites/publications/Files/Pub33574.pdf |archivedate=5 March 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unit 4 also filled with hydrogen, resulting in an explosion.

Coinciding with the [[Behavior of nuclear fuel during a reactor accident|well understood implications]] of a [[loss of coolant accident]], the insufficient cooling eventually led to [[nuclear meltdown|meltdowns]] in Reactors 1, 2, and 3. The full extent of the movement of the resulting [[corium (nuclear reactor)|corium]] is unknown but it is now considered to be at least through the bottom of each reactor pressure vessel(RPV), residing somewhere between there and the [[water-table]] below each reactor, in a similar manner to what was observed at reactor 4 in [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]].

In 2013, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) indicated that the residents of the area who were evacuated were exposed to low amounts of radiation and that radiation-induced health impacts are likely to be low.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/78218/1/9789241505130_eng.pdf WHO report, page 92.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="science.time.com"/&gt; In particular, the 2013 WHO report predicts that for evacuated [[infant]] girls, their 0.75% pre-accident lifetime risk of developing [[thyroid neoplasm|thyroid cancer]] is calculated to be increased to 1.25% by being exposed to [[radioiodine]], with the increase being slightly less for males.&lt;!-- does this WHO calculation assume they inhaled unfiltered air during the evacuation and weren't administered [[KI]]? Or does it assume they had a mask on and were administered KI? etc, and what of those that sheltered in place or who were evacuated into the fallout plum by mistake?--&gt; The risks from a number of additional [[radiation-induced cancer]]s are also expected to be elevated due to exposure caused by the other low boiling point [[fission product]]s that were released by the safety failures. The single greatest increase is for thyroid cancer, but in total, an overall 1% higher lifetime risk of developing cancers of all types, is predicted for infant females, with the risk slightly lower for males, making both some of the most [[radiosensitivity|radiation-sensitive]] groups.&lt;ref name="science.time.com"/&gt; The WHO predicted those [[human fetus|within the womb]], depending on their gender, would have the same elevations in risk as the infant groups.{{sfn|WHO|2013|pp=70, 79–80}}

A [[screening (medicine)|screening]] program a year later in 2012 found that more than a third (36%) of children in [[Fukushima Prefecture]] have [[thyroid neoplasm|abnormal growths in their thyroid glands]].&lt;ref name="Ryall"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/9410702/Nearly-36pc-of-Fukushima-children-diagnosed-with-thyroid-growths.html|title=Nearly 36pc of Fukushima children diagnosed with thyroid growths|last=Ryall|first=Julian|date=19 July 2012|work=|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2013, there have been more than 40 children newly diagnosed with [[thyroid cancer]] and other cancers in [[Fukushima prefecture]] as a whole. In 2015, the number of thyroid cancers or detections of developing thyroid cancers numbered 137.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; However, whether these incidences of cancer are elevated above the rate in un-contaminated areas and therefore were due to exposure to nuclear radiation is unknown at this stage.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Data from the [[Chernobyl accident]] showed that an unmistakable rise in thyroid cancer rates following the disaster in 1986 only began after a cancer incubation period of 3–5 years;&lt;ref name="hormones.gr"/&gt; however, whether this data can be directly compared to the Fukushima nuclear disaster is yet to be determined.&lt;ref name="rt.com"/&gt;

A survey by the newspaper ''Mainichi Shimbun'' computed that of some 300,000 people who evacuated the area, approximately 1,600 deaths related to the evacuation conditions, such as living in [[prefabricated home|temporary housing]] and hospital closures, had occurred as of August 2013, a number comparable to the 1,599 deaths directly caused by the earthquake and tsunami in the Fukushima Prefecture in 2011.

On 5 July 2012, the [[National Diet|Japanese National Diet]]-appointed [[#NAIIC|Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission]] (NAIIC) submitted its inquiry report to the Japanese Diet.&lt;ref name="National Diet of Japan Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission"/&gt; The Commission found the nuclear disaster was "manmade", that the direct causes of the accident were all foreseeable prior to 11 March 2011. The report also found that the Fukushima [[Dai-ichi|Daiichi]] Nuclear Power Plant was incapable of withstanding the earthquake and tsunami. TEPCO, the regulatory bodies ([[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency|NISA]] and NSC) and the government body promoting the nuclear power industry (METI), all failed to correctly develop the most basic safety requirements&amp;nbsp;– such as assessing the probability of damage, preparing for containing collateral damage from such a disaster, and developing evacuation plans for the public in the case of a serious radiation release. Meanwhile, the government-appointed [[#Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company|Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company]] submitted its final report to the Japanese government on 23 July 2012.&lt;ref name="Asahi20120723"/&gt; A separate study by Stanford researchers found that Japanese plants operated by the largest utility companies were particularly unprotected against potential tsunami.&lt;ref name=":182"/&gt;

The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant consisted of six GE [[light water reactor|light water]] [[boiling water reactor]]s (BWRs) with a combined power of 4.7 gigawatts, making it one of the world's 25 largest [[list of nuclear power stations|nuclear power stations]]. It was the first GE-designed nuclear plant to be constructed and run entirely by the [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]] (TEPCO). Reactor 1 was a 439 [[MWe#Electrical and thermal watts|MWe]] type (BWR-3) reactor constructed in July 1967, and commenced operation on 26 March 1971.&lt;ref name="Fukushima Daiichi Information Screen"/&gt; It was designed to withstand an earthquake with a [[peak ground acceleration]] of 0.18 [[g-force|g]] ({{Convert|1.4|m/s2||abbr=on|sp=us|disp=comma}}) and a [[response spectrum]] based on the [[1952 Kern County earthquake]].&lt;ref name="brady"/&gt; Reactors 2 and 3 were both 784 MWe type BWR-4s. Reactor 2 commenced operation in July 1974, and Reactor 3 in March 1976. The earthquake design basis for all units ranged from 0.42&amp;nbsp;g ({{Convert|4.12|m/s2||abbr=on|sp=us|disp=comma}}) to 0.46&amp;nbsp;g ({{Convert|4.52|m/s2||abbr=on|sp=us|disp=comma}}).&lt;ref name="tepco0401"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WWN24"/&gt; After the [[1978 Miyagi earthquake]], when the [[ground acceleration]] reached 0.125&amp;nbsp;g ({{Convert|1.22|m/s2||abbr=on|sp=us|disp=comma}}) for 30&amp;nbsp;seconds, no damage to the critical parts of the reactor was found.&lt;ref name="brady"/&gt; Units 1–5 have a [[Containment building#Boiling water reactors|Mark-1 type]] (light bulb [[torus]]) [[containment building|containment structure]]; unit 6 has Mark 2-type (over/under) containment structure.&lt;ref name="brady"/&gt; In September 2010, Reactor 3 was partially fueled by [[MOX fuel|mixed-oxides (MOX)]].&lt;ref name="ns"/&gt;

===Cooling===

[[File:Bwr-rpv.svg|thumb|upright|Diagram of the [[boiling water reactor safety systems|cooling systems of a BWR]]]]

{{See also|Decay heat#Power reactors in shutdown|Nuclear reactor safety system}}

Nuclear reactors generate electricity by using the heat of the [[nuclear fission|fission reaction]] to produce steam, which is used to drive turbines in order to generate electricity. When the reactor stops operating, the [[radioactive decay]] of unstable isotopes in the fuel continues to generate heat ([[decay heat]]) for a time, and so require continued cooling.&lt;ref name="Meltdown101"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Explainer: What caused the incident at Fukushima-Daiichi"/&gt; Initially this decay heat amounts to approximately 6.5% of the amount produced by fission,&lt;ref name="Meltdown101"/&gt; decreasing over several days before reaching [[shutdown (nuclear reactor)|shutdown]] levels.&lt;ref name="DOE fundamentals handbook – Decay heat, Nuclear physics and reactor theory"/&gt; Afterwards, spent fuel rods typically require several years in a [[spent fuel pool]] before they can be safely transferred to [[dry cask storage]] vessels.&lt;ref name="What if it happened here?"/&gt; The decay heat in the Unit 4 spent fuel pool had the capacity to boil about {{Convert|70|t||sp=us}} of water per day.&lt;ref name="More on spent fuel pools at Fukushima"/&gt;

In the reactor core, high-pressure systems cycle water between the reactor pressure vessel and [[heat exchanger]]s. These systems transfer heat to a secondary heat exchanger via the [[essential service water system]], using water pumped out to sea or an onsite [[cooling tower]].&lt;ref name="pcsr-09-06-29"/&gt; Units 2 and 3 were equipped with steam turbine-driven [[boiling water reactor safety systems|emergency core cooling systems]] that could be directly operated by steam produced by decay heat, and which could inject water directly into the reactor.&lt;ref name="Why has it become impossible for Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Station to cool reactor core?"/&gt; Some electrical power was needed to operate valves and monitoring systems.

Unit 1 was equipped with a different, entirely passive cooling system, the Isolation Condenser (IC). It consisted of a series of pipes run from the reactor core to the inside of a large tank of water. When the valves are opened, steam flows upward to the IC where the cool water in the tank condenses the steam back to water, and it runs under gravity back to the reactor core. For unknown reasons, Unit 1's IC was operated only intermittently during the emergency. However, during a 25 March 2014 presentation to the TVA, Dr Takeyuki Inagaki explained that the IC was being operated intermittently to maintain reactor vessel level and to prevent the core from cooling too quickly which can increase reactor power. Unfortunately, as the tsunami engulfed the station, the IC valves were closed and could not be reopened automatically due to the loss of electrical power, but could have been opened manually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nfb.ca/film/meltdown_doc|title=Meltdown|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 April 2011, TEPCO declared that cooling systems for Units 1–4 were beyond repair.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt;

===Backup generators===
When a reactor is not producing electricity, its cooling pumps can be powered by other reactor units, the grid, diesel generators, or batteries.&lt;ref name="nytimes2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Regulatory effectiveness of the station blackout rule"/&gt;

Two emergency diesel generators were available for each of Units 1–5 and three for Unit 6.&lt;ref name="NISASummary060411"/&gt;

In the late 1990s, three additional backup generators for Units 2 and 4 were placed in new buildings located higher on the hillside, to comply with new regulatory requirements. All six units were given access to these generators, but the switching stations that sent power from these backup generators to the reactors' cooling systems for Units 1 through 5 were still in the poorly protected turbine buildings. The switching station for Unit 6 was protected inside the only GE Mark II reactor building and continued to function.&lt;ref name="wsj1107"/&gt; All three of the generators added in the late 1990s were operational after the tsunami. If the switching stations had been moved to inside the reactor buildings or to other flood-proof locations, power would have been provided by these generators to the reactors' cooling systems.&lt;ref name="wsj1107"/&gt;

The reactor's emergency diesel generators and DC batteries, crucial components in powering cooling systems after a power loss, were located in the basements of the reactor turbine buildings, in accordance with GE's specifications. Mid-level GE engineers expressed concerns, relayed to Tepco, that this left them vulnerable to flooding.&lt;ref name="japantimes1"/&gt;

The Fukushima reactors were not designed for such a large tsunami,&lt;ref name="japantimes12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tsunami"/&gt; nor had the reactors been modified when concerns were raised in Japan and by the IAEA.&lt;ref name="wl"/&gt;

Fukushima II was also struck by the tsunami. However, it had incorporated design changes that improved its resistance to flooding, reducing flood damage. Generators and related electrical distribution equipment were located in the watertight reactor building, so that power from the electricity grid was being used by midnight.&lt;ref name="tepco"/&gt; Seawater pumps for cooling were protected from flooding, and although 3 of 4 initially failed, they were restored to operation.&lt;ref name="asahi"/&gt;

===Central fuel storage areas===
Used fuel assemblies taken from reactors are initially stored for at least 18 months in the pools adjacent to their reactors. They can then be transferred to the central fuel storage pond.&lt;ref name=IAEAtsunami1/&gt; Fukushima I's storage area contains 6375 fuel assemblies. After further cooling, fuel can be transferred to dry cask storage, which has shown no signs of abnormalities.&lt;ref name="world-nuclear-news.org"/&gt;

===Zircaloy===
Many of the internal components and fuel assembly cladding are made from [[zircaloy]] because it is relatively transparent to neutrons. At normal operating temperatures of approximately {{convert|300|C|F}}, zircaloy is inert. However, above {{convert|1200|C|F|abbr=out|sp=us}}, zirconium metal can react exothermically with water to form free [[hydrogen]] gas.&lt;ref name="The Japanese Nuclear Emergency – Sydney Technical Presentation"/&gt; The reaction between zirconium and the coolant produces more heat, accelerating the reaction.&lt;ref name="interaction"/&gt; In addition, zircaloy can react with uranium dioxide to form zirconium dioxide and uranium metal. This exothermic reaction together with the reaction of boron carbide with stainless steel can release additional heat energy, thus contributing to the overheating of a reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/23312009.2015.1049111 | volume=1 | title=An introduction to serious nuclear accident chemistry | year=2015 | journal=Cogent Chemistry | first1 = Mark Russell | last1 = St. John Foreman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prior safety concerns==

===1967: Layout of the emergency-cooling system===
[[File:Fukushima 1 Power Plant control room.jpg|thumb|The Fukushima reactor control room in 1999]]
On 27 February 2012, the [[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency]] ordered TEPCO to report its reasoning for changing the piping layout for the emergency cooling system.

The original plans separated the piping systems for two reactors in the isolation condenser from each other. However, the application for approval of the construction plan showed the two piping systems connected outside the reactor. The changes were not noted, in violation of regulations.&lt;ref name="mainichi1"/&gt;

After the tsunami, the isolation condenser should have taken over the function of the cooling pumps, by condensing the steam from the pressure vessel into water to be used for cooling the reactor. However, the condenser did not function properly and TEPCO could not confirm whether a valve was opened.

===1991: Backup generator of Reactor 1 flooded===
On 30 October 1991, one of two backup generators of Reactor 1 failed, after flooding in the reactor's basement. Seawater used for cooling leaked into the turbine building from a corroded pipe at 20 cubic meters per hour, as reported by former employees in December 2011. An engineer was quoted as saying that he informed his superiors of the possibility that a tsunami could damage the generators. TEPCO installed doors to prevent water from leaking into the generator rooms.

The [[Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission]] stated that it would revise its safety guidelines and would require the installation of additional power sources. On 29 December 2011, TEPCO admitted all these facts: its report mentioned that the room was flooded through a door and some holes for cables, but the power supply was not cut off by the flooding, and the reactor was stopped for one day. One of the two power sources was completely submerged, but its drive mechanism had remained unaffected.&lt;ref name="nhk1991"/&gt;

===2008: Tsunami study ignored===
In 2007, TEPCO set up a department to supervise its nuclear facilities. Until June 2011, its chairman was [[Masao Yoshida (nuclear engineer)|Masao Yoshida]], the Fukushima Daiichi chief. A 2008 in-house study identified an immediate need to better protect the facility from flooding by seawater. This study mentioned the possibility of tsunami-waves up to {{convert|10.2|m||sp=us}}. Headquarters officials insisted that such a risk was unrealistic and did not take the prediction seriously.&lt;ref name="mdn.mainichi.jp"/&gt;{{Verify source|date=July 2013}}

A Mr. Okamura of the Active Fault and Earthquake Research Center ([https://www.gsj.jp/en/about/index.html replaced in 2014] by [https://unit.aist.go.jp/ievg/en/ Research Institute of Earthquake and Volcano Geology (IEVG)], [https://www.gsj.jp/en/ Geological Survey of Japan (GSJ)], [[National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology|AIST]]) urged TEPCO and NISA to review their assumption of possible tsunami heights based on [[869 Sanriku earthquake|a ninth century earthquake]], but it was not seriously considered at that time.&lt;ref name="AFERC urged to review assumption on Tsunami in 2009"/&gt; The U.S. [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] warned of a risk of losing emergency power in 1991 (NUREG-1150) and NISA referred to the report in 2004. No action to mitigate the risk was taken.&lt;ref name="Fukushima Nuclear Accident - U.S. NRC warned a risk on emergency power 20 years ago"/&gt;

There were also government committees, such as one in the Cabinet Office in 2004, where warnings were ignored that tsunamis taller than the maximum of {{convert|5.6|m||sp=us}} forecast by TEPCO and government officials were possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/10/world/asia/critics-say-japan-ignored-warnings-of-nuclear-disaster.html|title=Nuclear Disaster in Japan Was Avoidable, Critics Contend|last=Fackler|first=Martin|date=March 9, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vulnerability to earthquakes===

Japan, like the rest of the [[Ring of Fire|Pacific Rim]], is in an active [[seismic zone]], prone to earthquakes. The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) had expressed concern about the ability of Japan's nuclear plants to withstand earthquakes. At a 2008 meeting of the [[G8|G8's]] Nuclear Safety and Security Group in Tokyo, an IAEA expert warned that a strong earthquake with a [[Richter magnitude scale#Richter magnitudes|magnitude]] above {{nowrap|7.0}} could pose a "serious problem" for Japan's nuclear power stations.&lt;ref name="IAEA warned Japan over nuclear quake risk: WikiLeaks"/&gt; The region had experienced three earthquakes of magnitude greater than 8, including the [[869 Sanriku earthquake]], the [[1896 Sanriku earthquake]], and the [[1933 Sanriku earthquake]].

{{Further|Timeline of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami}}

===Tōhoku earthquake===

The 9.0 [[moment magnitude scale|M&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake]] occurred at 14:46 on Friday, 11 March 2011, with the [[epicenter]] near [[Honshu]], the largest island of Japan.&lt;ref name="Earthquake.usgs.gov"/&gt; It produced maximum ground [[g-force]]s of 0.56, 0.52, 0.56 ({{Convert|5.50|,|5.07|and|abbr=on|sp=us|disp=comma|5.48|m/s2}}) at units 2, 3, and 5 respectively. This exceeded the earthquake reactor design tolerances of 0.45, 0.45, and 0.46&amp;nbsp;g ({{Convert|4.38|,|4.41|and|abbr=on|sp=us|disp=comma|4.52|m/s2}}). The shock values were within the design tolerances at units 1, 4, and 6.&lt;ref name=WWN24/&gt;

When the earthquake struck, units 1, 2, and 3 were operating, but units 4, 5, and 6 had been shut down for a scheduled inspection.&lt;ref name=tepco0401/&gt;&lt;ref name="tepco12a"/&gt; Reactors 1, 2, and 3 immediately shut down automatically;&lt;ref name="tepco11a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="japantimes34"/&gt; this meant the plant stopped generating electricity and could no longer use its own power.&lt;ref name="tepco11b"/&gt; One of the two connections to off-site power for units 1–3 also failed,&lt;ref name="tepco11b"/&gt; so 13 on-site emergency diesel generators began providing power.&lt;ref name="yomiuri.co.jp"/&gt;

===Tsunami and flooding===

The earthquake triggered a {{convert|13|to|15|m|sp=us|adj=on}}-high tsunami that arrived approximately 50&amp;nbsp;minutes later. The waves overtopped the plant's {{convert|5.7|m||sp=us|adj=on}} [[seawall]],&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jma"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg"/&gt; flooding the basements of the power plant's turbine buildings and disabling the emergency diesel generators&lt;ref name="NISASummary060411"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimesWilson/&gt;&lt;ref name="WNN"/&gt; at approximately 15:41.&lt;ref name=tepco11b/&gt;&lt;ref name="japantimes35"/&gt; TEPCO then notified authorities of a "first-level emergency".&lt;ref name="tepco11a"/&gt; The switching stations that provided power from the three backup generators located higher on the hillside failed when the building that housed them flooded.&lt;ref name="wsj1107"/&gt; Power for the plant's control systems switched to batteries designed to provide power for about eight hours.&lt;ref name="bwokada"/&gt; Further batteries and mobile generators were dispatched to the site, but were delayed by poor road conditions; the first arrived at 21:00 11 March,&lt;ref name="yomiuri.co.jp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Japan Earthquake Update (2210 CET)"/&gt; almost six hours after the tsunami struck.

Unsuccessful attempts were made to connect portable generating equipment to power water pumps.

===Evacuation===
The government initially set in place a four-stage evacuation process: a prohibited access area out to {{Convert|3|km||abbr=on|sp=us}}, an on-alert area {{Convert|3-20|km||abbr=on|sp=us}} and an evacuation prepared area {{Convert|20-30|km||abbr=on|sp=us}}. &lt;!-- These evacuation areas were based on [[radioactivity]] levels above 20 mSv.= Bullshit (SIGHH). mSv is unit of (equivalent) dose; 20 mSv/year would be closer to a "radioactivity level" but still pretty vague (not specifying what exactly is measured or guessed or how (by which model) the "equivalence" is calculated. And I could not find any mention of this number in refs BBC15,Rian15 --&gt;On day one, an estimated 170,000 people&lt;ref&gt;AP, "IAEA: 170,000 Evacuated near Japan nuclear plant," 12 March 2011. https://news.yahoo.com/iaea-170-000-evacuated-near-japan-nuclear-plant-20110312-133929-901.html accessed 23 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; were evacuated from the prohibited access and on-alert areas. Prime Minister Kan instructed people within the on-alert area to leave and urged those in the prepared area to stay indoors.&lt;ref name="BBC15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rian15"/&gt; The latter groups were urged to evacuate on 25 March.&lt;ref name=evac/&gt; The {{Convert|20|km||abbr=on|sp=us|adj=on}} exclusion zone was guarded by roadblocks to ensure that fewer people would be affected by the radiation.&lt;ref name="VOA Correspondent Reaches Crippled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant"/&gt; During the evacuation of hospitals and nursing homes, 51 patients and elderly people died.&lt;ref name=51died&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/AdditionalVolumes/P1710/Pub1710-TV3-Web.pdf|title=The Fukushima Daiichi Accident.

The earthquake and tsunami damaged or destroyed more than one million buildings leading to a total of 470,000 people needing evacuation. Of the 470,000, the nuclear accident was responsible for 154,000 being evacuated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reconstruction.go.jp/english/topics/GEJE/index.html|title=Reconstruction Agency|website=www.reconstruction.go.jp|access-date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 March, a similar explosion occurred in the Reactor 3 building, blowing off the roof and injuring eleven people.&lt;ref name=injuries /&gt; On the 15th, there was an explosion in the Reactor 4 building due to a shared vent pipe with Reactor 3.

====Core meltdowns====
The amount of damage sustained by the [[nuclear reactor core|reactor cores]] during the accident, and the location of molten nuclear fuel ("[[corium (nuclear reactor)|corium]]") within the [[containment building]]s, is unknown; TEPCO has revised its estimates several times.&lt;ref name="phys"/&gt; On 16 March 2011, TEPCO estimated that 70% of the fuel in Unit 1 had melted and 33% in Unit 2, and that Unit 3's core might also be damaged.&lt;ref name="scientificamerican"/&gt; As of 2015 it can be assumed that most fuel melted through the reactor pressure vessel (RPV), commonly known as the "reactor core", and is resting on the bottom of the primary containment vessel (PCV), having been stopped by the PCV concrete.&lt;ref name="fukushima-diary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fukudiary201408"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fukuleaks13608"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fukuleaks13619"/&gt; In July 2017 a remotely controlled robot filmed for the first time apparently melted fuel, just below the pressure vessel of Unit 3.&lt;ref name=jt-20170721&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/07/21/national/fukushima-robot-finds-potential-fuel-debris-hanging-like-icicles-reactor-3/ |title=Fukushima robot finds potential fuel debris hanging like icicles in reactor 3 |agency=Bloomberg |newspaper=The Japan Times |date=21 July 2017 |accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TEPCO released further estimates of the state and location of the fuel in a November 2011 report.&lt;ref name="tepco6"/&gt; The report concluded that the Unit 1 RPV was damaged during the disaster and that "significant amounts" of molten fuel had fallen into the bottom of the PCV. The erosion of the concrete of the PCV by the molten fuel after the core meltdown was estimated to stop at approx. {{convert|0.7|m||sp=us}} in depth, while the thickness of the containment is {{convert|7.6|m||sp=us}} thick. Gas sampling carried out before the report detected no signs of an ongoing reaction of the fuel with the concrete of the PCV and all the fuel in Unit 1 was estimated to be "well cooled down, including the fuel dropped on the bottom of the reactor". Fuel in Units 2 and 3 had melted, however less than in Unit 1, and fuel was presumed to be still in the RPV, with no significant amounts of fuel fallen to the bottom of the PCV.{{update inline|date=February 2017}} The report further suggested that "there is a range in the evaluation results" from "all fuel in the RPV (none fuel fallen to the PCV)" in Unit 2 and Unit 3, to "most fuel in the RPV (some fuel in PCV)". For Unit 2 and Unit 3 it was estimated that the "fuel is cooled sufficiently". According to the report, the greater damage in Unit 1 (when compared to  the other two units) was due to the longer time that no cooling water was injected in Unit 1. This resulted in much more [[decay heat]]  accumulating, as for about 1 day there was no water injection for Unit 1, while Unit 2 and Unit 3 had only a quarter of a day without water injection.&lt;ref name="tepco6"/&gt;

In November 2013, Mari Yamaguchi reported for Associated Press that there are computer simulations which suggest that "the melted fuel in Unit 1, whose core damage was the most extensive, has breached the bottom of the primary containment vessel and even partially eaten into its concrete foundation, coming within about {{Convert|30|cm|ft|0|sp=us}} of leaking into the ground" – a Kyoto University nuclear engineer said with regards to these estimates: "We just can't be sure until we actually see the inside of the reactors."&lt;ref name="phys"/&gt;

According to a December 2013 report, TEPCO estimated for Unit 1 that "the decay heat must have decreased enough, the molten fuel can be assumed to remain in PCV (primary container vessel)".&lt;ref name="fukushima-diary"/&gt;

In August 2014, TEPCO released a new revised estimate that Reactor 3 had a complete melt through in the initial phase of the accident. According to this new estimate within the first three days of the accident the entire core content of Reactor 3 had melted through the RPV and fallen to the bottom of the PCV.&lt;ref name="fukuleaks13608"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fukuleaks.org/web/?p=13608|title=TEPCO Admits Unit 3 Had Total Melt Through|work=SimplyInfo|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fukuleaks13619"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fukuleaks.org/web/?p=13619|title=Fukushima Unit 3 Reactor Vessel Failure Preceded Explosion|work=SimplyInfo|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/betu14_e/images/140806e0101.pdf|title=Report on the Investigation and Study of Unconfirmed/Unclear Matters in the Fukushima Nuclear Accident – Progress Report No.2 – 6 August 2014 Tokyo Electric Power Company, Inc.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These estimates were based on a simulation, which indicated that Reactor 3's melted core penetrated through {{convert|1.2|m||sp=us}} of the PCV's concrete base, and came close to {{convert|26|-|68|cm|sp=us}} of the PCV's steel wall.&lt;ref name="fukudiary201408"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fukushima-diary.com/2014/08/reactor-3-fuel-is-assumed-to-have-melted-concrete-base-up-to-26cm-to-the-wall-of-primary-vessel/|title=Reactor 3 fuel is assumed to have melted concrete base up to 26cm to the wall of primary vessel.|work=Fukushima Diary|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, TEPCO started the [[muon tomography|muon scanning]] process for Units 1, 2, and 3.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fukushima-diary.com/2015/01/tepco-start-scanning-inside-reactor-1-early-february-using-muon/ TEPCO to start "scanning" inside of Reactor 1 in early February by using muon] – Fukushima Diary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fukuleaks.org/web/?p=14380 Muon Scans Begin At Fukushima Daiichi] – SimplyInfo&lt;/ref&gt; With this scanning setup it will be possible to determine the approximate amount and location of the remaining nuclear fuel within the RPV, but not the amount and resting place of the corium in the PCV. In March 2015 TEPCO released the result of the muon scan for Unit 1 which showed that no fuel was visible in the RPV, which would suggest that most if not all of the molten fuel had dropped onto the bottom of the PCV – this will change the plan for the removal of the fuel from Unit 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fukuleaks.org/web/?p=14602 Muon Scan Finds No Fuel In Fukushima Unit 1 Reactor Vessel] – SimplyInfo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fukushima-diary.com/2015/03/irid-saw-no-fuel-or-water-remaining-in-reactor-core-of-reactor-1/ IRID saw no fuel or water remaining in reactor core of Reactor 1] – Fukushima Diary&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, six years after the disaster, radiation levels inside the Unit 2 containment building were crudely estimated to be about 650 Sv/h.&lt;ref name=jt-20170210&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/02/10/national/high-radiation-readings-at-fukushima-no-2-reactor/ |title=High radiation readings at Fukushima's No. 2 reactor complicate robot-based probe |newspaper=The Japan Times |date=10 February 2017 |accessdate=11 February 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215025105/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/02/10/national/high-radiation-readings-at-fukushima-no-2-reactor/#.WMTiA4WcGZ8|archivedate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estimation was revised later to 80 Sv/h.&lt;ref name="nhk20170728"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20170728/k10011077611000.html |script-title=ja:東電 ２号機 格納容器の放射線量を大幅訂正 |language=Japanese |publisher=NHK |date=28 July 2017 |accessdate=28 July 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727224247/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20170728/k10011077611000.html |archivedate=27 July 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; These readings were the highest recorded since the disaster occurred in 2011 and the first recorded in that area of the reactor since the meltdowns.

In January 2018, a remote-controlled camera confirmed that nuclear fuel debris was at the bottom of the Unit 2 PCV, showing fuel had escaped the RPV.

[[File:Exposed Reactor Pressure Vessel at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant Unit 4.jpg|thumb|Unit 4 after the hydrogen explosion. The bright yellow object is the lid of the Reactor Containment Vessel. The green object is the crane for the spent fuel pool.]]

====Unit 4====
Reactor 4 was not operating when the earthquake struck. All fuel rods from Unit 4 had been transferred to the [[spent fuel pool]] on an upper floor of the reactor building prior to the tsunami. On 15 March, an explosion damaged the fourth floor rooftop area of Unit 4, creating two large holes in a wall of the outer building. It was reported that water in the spent fuel pool might be boiling. Radiation inside the Unit 4 control room prevented workers from staying there for long periods. Visual inspection of the spent fuel pool on 30 April revealed no significant damage to the rods. A radiochemical examination of the pond water confirmed that little of the fuel had been damaged.&lt;ref name="Most fuel in Fukushima 4 pool undamaged"/&gt;

In October 2012, the former Japanese Ambassador to Switzerland and Senegal, Mitsuhei Murata, said that the ground under Fukushima Unit 4 was sinking, and the structure may collapse.&lt;ref name="Japan Diplomat: Ground underneath Fukushima Unit 4 is sinking – More than 30&amp;nbsp;inches in some areas – Now in danger of collapse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enenews"/&gt;

In November 2013, TEPCO began moving the 1533 fuel rods in the Unit 4 cooling pool to the central pool. This process was completed on 22 December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/2014/1246703_5892.html |accessdate=24 December 2014 |title=Fuel Removal From Unit 4 Reactor Building Completed at Fukushima Daiichi |date=22 December 2014 |publisher=TEPCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Units 5 and 6====
Reactors 5 and 6 were also not operating when the earthquake struck. Unlike Reactor 4, their fuel rods remained in the reactor. The reactors had been closely monitored, as cooling processes were not functioning well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/03/15/japan.nuclear.reactors/?hpt=T1|title=Agency: Damaged container may be causing smoke, radiation spike|first=CNN Wire|last=Staff|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Unit 5 and Unit 6 shared a working generator and switchgear during the emergency and achieved a successful cold shutdown nine days later on 20 March.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110523050825/http://www.nisa.meti.go.jp/english/files/en20110322-1-1.pdf NISA news release&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj1107"/&gt;

Radioactive material was released from the containment vessels for several reasons: deliberate venting to reduce gas pressure, deliberate discharge of coolant water into the sea, and uncontrolled events. Concerns about the possibility of a large scale release led to a {{convert|20|km||sp=us|adj=on}} exclusion zone around the power plant and recommendations that people within the surrounding {{Convert|20-30|km||abbr=on|sp=us|adj=on}} zone stay indoors. Later, the UK, France, and some other countries told their nationals to consider leaving Tokyo, in response to fears of spreading contamination.&lt;ref name="Aus2"/&gt; In 2015, the tap water contamination was still higher in Tokyo compared to other cities in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fukuleaks.org/web/?p=14751 |title=Fukushima Radiation Found In Tap Water Around Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trace amounts of radioactivity, including [[iodine-131]], [[caesium-134]], and [[caesium-137]], were widely observed.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seattletimes.nwsource.com"/&gt;

Between 21 March and mid-July, around 27&amp;nbsp;PBq of caesium-137 (about {{Convert|8.4|kg||abbr=on|sp=us|disp=or}}) entered the ocean, with about 82&amp;nbsp;percent having flowed into the sea before 8 April.&lt;ref name="IRSN-Oct-2011"/&gt; However, the Fukushima coast has some of the world's strongest currents and these transported the contaminated waters far into the [[Pacific Ocean]], thus causing great dispersion of the radioactive elements. The results of measurements of both the seawater and the coastal sediments led to the supposition that the consequences of the accident, in terms of radioactivity, would be minor for marine life as of autumn 2011 (weak concentration of radioactivity in the water and limited accumulation in sediments). On the other hand, significant pollution of sea water along the coast near the nuclear plant might persist, due to the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported towards the sea by surface water running over contaminated soil. Organisms that filter water and fish at the top of the food chain are, over time, the most sensitive to caesium pollution. It is thus justified to maintain surveillance of marine life that is fished in the coastal waters off Fukushima. Despite caesium isotopic concentrations in the waters off of Japan being 10 to 1000 times above the normal concentrations prior to the accident, radiation risks are below what is generally considered harmful to marine animals and human consumers.&lt;ref name="Fukushima-derived radionuclides in the ocean and biota off Japan"/&gt;

Researchers at the [[University of Tokyo]]'s Underwater Technology Research Center towed detectors behind boats to map hot spots on the ocean floor off Fukushima. Blair Thornton, an associate professor the university, said in 2013 that radiation levels remained hundreds of times as high as in other areas of the sea floor, suggesting ongoing contamination (at the time) from the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/25/world/asia/with-a-plants-tainted-water-still-flowing-no-end-to-environmental-fears.html|title=With a Plant's Tainted Water Still Flowing, No End to Environmental Fears|last1=Fackler|first1=Martin|last2=Tabuchi|first2=Hiroko|date=October 24, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A monitoring system operated by the [[Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]] (CTBTO) tracked the spread of radioactivity on a global scale. Radioactive isotopes were picked up by over 40 monitoring stations.&lt;ref name="CTBTO to Share Data with IAEA and WHO"/&gt;

On 12 March, radioactive releases first reached a CTBTO monitoring station in Takasaki, Japan, around {{Convert|200|km||abbr=on|sp=us|adj=on}} away. The radioactive isotopes appeared in eastern Russia on 14 March and the west coast of the United States two days later. By day 15, traces of radioactivity were detectable all across the northern hemisphere. Within one month, radioactive particles were noted by CTBTO stations in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Fukushima-Related Measurements by the CTBTO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CTBTO Trakcs Fukushima's Radioactive Release"/&gt;

Estimates of radioactivity released ranged from 10–40%&lt;ref name="Frank N. von Hippel 27–36"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abcnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reactor accident Fukushima – New international study"/&gt;&lt;ref name="No-man's land attests to Japan's nuclear nightmare"/&gt; of that of Chernobyl. The significantly contaminated area was 10&lt;ref name="Frank N. von Hippel 27–36"/&gt;-12%&lt;ref name="abcnews1"/&gt; of that of Chernobyl.&lt;ref name="Frank N. von Hippel 27–36"/&gt;&lt;ref name="radioactivity"/&gt;&lt;ref name="japantimes17"/&gt;

In March 2011, Japanese officials announced that "radioactive iodine-131 exceeding safety limits for infants had been detected at 18 water-purification plants in Tokyo and five other prefectures".&lt;ref name="Report: Emissions from Japan plant approach Chernobyl levels"/&gt; On 21 March, the first restrictions were placed on the distribution and consumption of contaminated items.&lt;ref name="Safety regulations of food and water implemented in the first year following the Fukushima nuclear accident"/&gt; {{As of|2011|July}}, the Japanese government was unable to control the spread of radioactive material into the nation's food supply. Radioactive material was detected in food produced in 2011, including spinach, tea leaves, milk, fish, and beef, up to 320&amp;nbsp;kilometres from the plant. 2012 crops did not show signs of radioactivity contamination. Cabbage, rice&lt;ref name="福島産の新米、東京で販売開始　全袋検査に合格"&gt;{{cite news |script-title=ja:福島産の新米、東京で販売開始　全袋検査に合格|url=http://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXNASDG0102S_R00C12A9CR8000/|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=''共同'' Nikkei Kyodo news|date=1 September 2012 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131203094456/http://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXNASDG0102S_R00C12A9CR8000/ |archivedate= 3 December 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and beef showed insignificant levels of radioactivity. A Fukushima-produced rice market in Tokyo was accepted by consumers as safe.&lt;ref name="福島産の新米、東京で販売開始　全袋検査に合格"/&gt;

On 24 August 2011, the Nuclear Safety Commission (NSC) of Japan published the results of the recalculation of the total amount of radioactive materials released into the air during the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. The total amounts released between 11 March and 5 April were revised downwards to 130&amp;nbsp;PBq ([[becquerel#Prefixes|petabecquerels]], 3.5 mega[[curie]]s) for iodine-131 and 11&amp;nbsp;PBq for caesium-137, which is about 11% of Chernobyl emissions. Earlier estimations were 150&amp;nbsp;PBq and 12&amp;nbsp;PBq.&lt;ref name="jaif"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nisa-ines-2011-04-12"/&gt;

In 2011, scientists working for the Japan Atomic Energy Agency, Kyoto University and other institutes, recalculated the amount of radioactive material released into the ocean: between late March through April they found a total of 15&amp;nbsp;PBq for the combined amount of iodine-131 and caesium-137, more than triple the 4.72&amp;nbsp;PBq estimated by TEPCO. The company had calculated only the direct releases into the sea. The new calculations incorporated the portion of airborne radioactive substances that entered the ocean as rain.&lt;ref name="jaif8"/&gt;

In the first half of September 2011, TEPCO estimated the radioactivity release at some 200&amp;nbsp;MBq (megabecquerels, 5.4 milli[[curie]]s) per hour. This was approximately one four-millionth that of March.&lt;ref name="jaif9"/&gt; Traces of iodine-131 were detected in several Japanese prefectures in November&lt;ref name="fukushima-diary10"/&gt; and December 2011.&lt;ref name="fukushima-diary11"/&gt;

According to the [[Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire|French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety]], between 21 March and mid-July around 27&amp;nbsp;PBq of caesium-137 entered the ocean, about 82&amp;nbsp;percent before 8 April. This emission represents the most important individual oceanic emissions of artificial radioactivity ever observed. The Fukushima coast has one of the world's strongest currents ([[Kuroshio Current]]). It transported the contaminated waters far into the Pacific Ocean, dispersing the radioactivity. As of late 2011 measurements of both the seawater and the coastal sediments suggested that the consequences for marine life would be minor. Significant pollution along the coast near the plant might persist, because of the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported to the sea by surface water crossing contaminated soil. The possible presence of other radioactive substances, such as [[strontium-90]] or [[plutonium]], has not been sufficiently studied. Recent measurements show persistent contamination of some marine species (mostly fish) caught along the Fukushima coast.&lt;ref name="Synthèse actualisée des connaissances relatives à l'impact sur le milieu marin des rejets radioactifs du site nucléaire accidenté de Fukushima Dai-ichi"/&gt; Migratory [[pelagic fish|pelagic species]] are highly effective and rapid transporters of radioactivity throughout the ocean. Elevated levels of caesium-134 appeared in migratory species off the coast of California that were not seen pre-Fukushima.&lt;ref name="Pacific bluefin tuna transport Fukushima-derived radionuclides from Japan to California"/&gt; Scientists have also discovered increased traces of [[radioactive isotope]] [[Caesium-137]] in wine grown in a vineyard in [[Napa Valley]], California. The trace-level radioactivity was in dust blown across the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/20/science/fukushima-radiation-levels-california-wine-nyt.html|title=Fukushima's Nuclear Imprint Is Found in California Wine (Drinkers, Don't Panic)|publisher=|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2018-07-20|last1=Zaveri|first1=Mihir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2012, no cases of radiation-related ailments had been reported. Experts cautioned that data was insufficient to allow conclusions on health impacts. Michiaki Kai, professor of radiation protection at [[Oita University of Nursing and Health Sciences]], stated, "If the current radiation dose estimates are correct, (cancer-related deaths) likely won't increase."&lt;ref name="japantimes112"/&gt;

In May 2012, TEPCO released their estimate of cumulative radioactivity releases. An estimated 538.1&amp;nbsp;PBq of iodine-131, caesium-134 and caesium-137 was released. 520&amp;nbsp;PBq was released into the atmosphere between 12–31 March 2011 and 18.1&amp;nbsp;PBq into the ocean from 26 March – 30 September 2011. A total of 511&amp;nbsp;PBq of iodine-131 was released into both the atmosphere and the ocean, 13.5&amp;nbsp;PBq of caesium-134 and 13.6&amp;nbsp;PBq of caesium-137.&lt;ref name="TEPCO Press Release"/&gt; TEPCO reported that at least 900&amp;nbsp;PBq had been released "into the atmosphere in March last year [2011] alone".&lt;ref name="Kevin Krolicki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="english.kyodonews.jp"/&gt;

In 2012 researchers from the Institute of Problems in the Safe Development of Nuclear Energy, Russian Academy of Sciences, and the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia concluded that "on March 15, 2011, ~400 PBq iodine, ~100 PBq caesium, and ~400 PBq inert gases entered the atmosphere" on that day alone.&lt;ref name="radionuclide"/&gt;

In August 2012, researchers found that 10,000 nearby residents had been exposed to less than 1 [[millisievert]] of radiation, significantly less than Chernobyl residents.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost13"/&gt;

As of October 2012, radioactivity was still leaking into the ocean. Fishing in the waters around the site was still prohibited, and the levels of radioactive &lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs and &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs in the fish caught were not lower than immediately after the disaster.&lt;ref name="sciencemag480"/&gt;

On 26 October 2012, TEPCO admitted that it could not stop radioactive material entering the ocean, although emission rates had stabilized. Undetected leaks could not be ruled out, because the reactor basements remained flooded. The company was building a 2,400-foot-long steel and concrete wall between the site and the ocean, reaching {{Convert|100|ft||sp=us}} below ground, but it would not be finished before mid-2014. Around August 2012 two [[greenling]] were caught close to shore. They contained more than 25,000 becquerels (0.67 milli[[curie]]s) of caesium-137 per kilogram ({{Convert|25000|Bq/kg|Bq/lb uCi/lb|lk=out|sp=us|disp=out}}), the highest measured since the disaster and 250 times the government's safety limit.&lt;ref name="Fish Off Japan's Coast Said to Contain Elevated Levels of Cesium"/&gt;&lt;ref name="www"/&gt;

&lt;!-- -Greater scientific detail concerning these newly disclosed releases would be beneficial to the article. --&gt;
On 22 July 2013, it was revealed by TEPCO that the plant continued to leak radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean, something long suspected by local fishermen and independent investigators.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt; TEPCO had previously denied that this was happening. Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe]] ordered the government to step in.&lt;ref name="bloomberg1"/&gt;

On 20 August, in a further incident, it was announced that {{Convert|300|t||sp=us}} of heavily contaminated water had leaked from a storage tank,&lt;ref name="reuters-20130821"/&gt; approximately the same amount of water as one eighth (1/8) of that found in an [[Olympic-size swimming pool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/wmd/metric/volume.cfm|title=SI Units – Volume|first=Isabel|last=Chavez|date=1 August 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{Convert|300|t||sp=us}} of water was radioactive enough to be hazardous to nearby staff, and the leak was assessed as Level 3 on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]].&lt;ref name="bbc-20130821"/&gt;

On 26 August, the government took charge of emergency measures to prevent further radioactive water leaks, reflecting their lack of confidence in TEPCO.&lt;ref name="bw-20130826"/&gt;

As of 2013, about {{Convert|400|t||sp=us}} of water per day of cooling water was being pumped into the reactors. Another {{Convert|400|t||sp=us}} of groundwater was seeping into the structure. Some {{Convert|800|t||sp=us}} of water per day was removed for treatment, half of which was reused for cooling and half diverted to storage tanks.&lt;ref name="wnn-20130926"/&gt; Ultimately the contaminated water, after treatment to remove radionuclides other than [[tritium]], may have to be dumped into the Pacific.&lt;ref name="guardian-20140310"/&gt; TEPCO intend to create an underground ice wall to reduce the rate contaminated groundwater reaches the sea.&lt;ref name="nei-20140218"/&gt;

In February 2014, NHK reported that TEPCO was reviewing its radioactivity data, after finding much higher levels of radioactivity than was reported earlier. TEPCO now says that levels of 5 MBq (0.12 milli[[curie]]s) of strontium per liter ({{Convert|5|MBq/l|MBq/impgal MBq/usgal uCi/impgal uCi/usgal|lk=on|sp=us|disp=out}}) were detected in groundwater collected in July 2013 and not the 900 kBq (0.02 milli[[curie]]s) ({{Convert|900|kBq/l|MBq/impgal MBq/usgal uCi/impgal uCi/usgal|lk=on|sp=us|disp=out}}) that were initially reported.&lt;ref name="Varma"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TEPCO to review erroneous radiation data"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TEPCO to Review Erroneous Radiation Data"/&gt;

On 10 September 2015, floodwaters driven by Typhoon Etau prompted mass evacuations in Japan and overwhelmed the drainage pumps at the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant. A TEPCO spokesperson said that hundreds of metric tons of radioactive water had entered the ocean as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Japan floods: After typhoon, rivers overflow, nuclear water|url= http://www.bangkokpost.com/learning/learning-from-news/688236/japan-floods-after-typhoon-rivers-overflow-nuclear-water|accessdate= 10 September 2015|first= John|last= Fernquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plastic bags filled with contaminated soil and grass were also swept away by the flood waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Flooding swept away radiation cleanup bags in Fukushima|url= http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/09/12/national/flooding-swept-away-radiation-cleanup-bags-in-fukushima/|newspaper= The Japan Times Online|date= 12 September 2015|access-date= 13 September 2015|issn= 0447-5763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contamination in the eastern Pacific====

In March 2014, numerous news sources, including [[NBC]],&lt;ref name="nbcnews"/&gt; began predicting that the radioactive underwater [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] traveling through the Pacific Ocean would reach the western seaboard of the [[continental United States]]. The common story was that the amount of radioactivity would be harmless and temporary once it arrived. The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] measured caesium-134 at points in the Pacific Ocean and models were cited in predictions by several government agencies to announce that the radiation would not be a health hazard for North American residents. Groups, including [[Beyond Nuclear]] and the Tillamook Estuaries Partnership, challenged these predictions on the basis of continued isotope releases after 2011, leading to a demand for more recent and comprehensive measurements as the radioactivity made its way east. These measurements were taken by a cooperative group of organizations under the guidance of a marine chemist with the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], and it was revealed that total radiation levels, of which only a fraction bore the fingerprint of Fukushima, were not high enough to pose any direct risk to human life and in fact were far less than [[Environmental Protection Agency]] guidelines or several other sources of radiation exposure deemed safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Science|last=Sherwood|first=Courtney|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/asiapacific/2014/11/fukushima-radiation-nears-california-coast-judged-harmless|title=Fukushima radiation nears California coast, judged harmless|date=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrated Fukushima Ocean Radionuclide Monitoring project (InFORM) also failed to show any significant amount of radiation&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |title= British Columbia {{!}} Home|url= http://fukushimainform.ca/category/peer-reviewed/location/british-columbia/|website= fukushimainform.ca|accessdate= 2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result its authors received [[death threats]] from supporters of a Fukushima-induced "wave of cancer deaths across North America" theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Canadian researcher targeted by hate campaign over Fukushima findings|url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/canadian-researcher-targeted-by-hate-campaign-over-fukushima-findings/article27060613/|website= The Globe and Mail|accessdate= 2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
{{See also|Investigations into the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster}}
Government agencies and TEPCO were unprepared for the "cascading nuclear disaster".&lt;ref name=bas111/&gt; The tsunami that "began the nuclear disaster could and should have been anticipated and that ambiguity about the roles of public and private institutions in such a crisis was a factor in the poor response at Fukushima".&lt;ref name="bas111"/&gt; In March 2012, Prime Minister [[Yoshihiko Noda]] said that the government shared the blame for the Fukushima disaster, saying that officials had been blinded by a false belief in the country's "technological infallibility", and were taken in by a "safety myth". Noda said "Everybody must share the pain of responsibility."&lt;ref name="Japanese Prime Minister Says Government Shares Blame for Nuclear Disaster"/&gt;

According to [[Naoto Kan]], Japan's prime minister during the tsunami, the country was unprepared for the disaster, and nuclear power plants should not have been built so close to the ocean.&lt;ref name=kan12/&gt; Kan acknowledged flaws in authorities' handling of the crisis, including poor communication and coordination between nuclear regulators, utility officials, and the government. He said the disaster "laid bare a host of an even bigger man-made vulnerabilities in Japan's nuclear industry and regulation, from inadequate safety guidelines to crisis management, all of which he said need to be overhauled."&lt;ref name="kan12"/&gt;

Physicist and environmentalist [[Amory Lovins]] said that Japan's "rigid bureaucratic structures, reluctance to send bad news upwards, need to save face, weak development of policy alternatives, eagerness to preserve nuclear power's public acceptance, and politically fragile government, along with TEPCO's very hierarchical management culture, also contributed to the way the accident unfolded. Moreover, the information Japanese people receive about nuclear energy and its alternatives has long been tightly controlled by both TEPCO and the government."&lt;ref name="Amory Lovins 2011"/&gt;

===Poor communication and delays===

The Japanese government did not keep records of key meetings during the crisis.&lt;ref name="Japan did not keep records of nuclear disaster meetings"/&gt; Data from the [[radiation monitoring in Japan#SPEEDI Network|SPEEDI network]] were emailed to the prefectural government, but not shared with others. Emails from NISA to Fukushima, covering 12 March 11:54&amp;nbsp;PM to 16 March 9&amp;nbsp;AM and holding vital information for evacuation and health advisories, went unread and were deleted. The data was not used because the disaster countermeasure office regarded the data as "useless because the predicted amount of released radiation is unrealistic."&lt;ref name="Fukushima Pref. deleted 5 days of radiation dispersion data just after meltdowns"/&gt; On 14 March 2011 TEPCO officials were instructed not to use the phrase "core meltdown" at press conferences.&lt;ref name="nei-20160624"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newstepco-concealed-core-meltdowns-during-fukushima-accident-4931915 |title=Tepco concealed core meltdowns during Fukushima accident |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=24 June 2016 |accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 15 March, Prime Minister Kan called Seiki Soramoto, who used to design nuclear plants for Toshiba, to ask for his help in managing the escalating crisis. Soramoto formed an impromptu advisory group, which included his former professor at the University of Tokyo, Toshiso Kosako, a top Japanese expert on radiation measurement. Mr. Kosako, who studied the Soviet response to the Chernobyl crisis, said he was stunned at how little the leaders in the prime minister's office knew about the resources available to them. He quickly advised the chief cabinet secretary, Yukio Edano, to use SPEEDI, which used measurements of radioactive releases, as well as weather and topographical data, to predict where radioactive materials could travel after being released into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/world/asia/09japan.html|title=Japan Held Nuclear Data, Leaving Evacuees in Peril|last1=Onishi|first1=Norimitsu|last2=Fackler|first2=Martin|date=August 8, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company]]'s interim report stated that Japan's response was flawed by "poor communication and delays in releasing data on dangerous radiation leaks at the facility". The report blamed Japan's central government as well as TEPCO, "depicting a scene of harried officials incapable of making decisions to stem radiation leaks as the situation at the coastal plant worsened in the days and weeks following the disaster".&lt;ref name=yotaro2011/&gt; The report said poor planning worsened the disaster response, noting that authorities had "grossly underestimated tsunami risks" that followed the magnitude 9.0 earthquake. The {{Convert|12.1|m||sp=us|adj=on}} high tsunami that struck the plant was double the height of the highest wave predicted by officials. The erroneous assumption that the plant's cooling system would function after the tsunami worsened the disaster. "Plant workers had no clear instructions on how to respond to such a disaster, causing miscommunication, especially when the disaster destroyed backup generators."&lt;ref name="yotaro2011"/&gt;

In February 2012, the Rebuild Japan Initiative Foundation described how Japan's response was hindered by a loss of trust between the major actors: Prime Minister Kan, TEPCO's Tokyo headquarters and the plant manager. The report said that these conflicts "produced confused flows of sometimes contradictory information".&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kan hero, or irate meddler?"/&gt; According to the report, Kan delayed the cooling of the reactors by questioning the choice of seawater instead of fresh water, accusing him of micromanaging response efforts and appointing a small, closed, decision-making staff. The report stated that the Japanese government was slow to accept assistance from U.S. nuclear experts.&lt;ref name="Panel lays bare Fukushima recipe for disaster"/&gt;

A 2012 report in ''[[The Economist]]'' said: "The operating company was poorly regulated and did not know what was going on. The operators made mistakes. The representatives of the safety inspectorate fled. Some of the equipment failed. The establishment repeatedly played down the risks and suppressed information about the movement of the radioactive plume, so some people were evacuated from more lightly to more heavily contaminated places."&lt;ref name="Blow-ups happen: Nuclear plants can be kept safe only by constantly worrying about their dangers"/&gt;

From 17 to 19 March 2011, US military aircraft measured radiation within a {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on|sp=us|adj=on}} radius of the site. The data recorded 125 micro[[sievert]]s per hour of radiation as far as {{convert|25|km|mi|1|abbr=on|sp=us}} northwest of the plant. The US provided detailed maps to the Japanese [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]] (METI) on 18 March and to the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT) two days later, but officials did not act on the information.&lt;ref name="Japan sat on U.S. radiation maps showing immediate fallout from nuke crisis"/&gt;

The data were not forwarded to the prime minister's office or the [[Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission|Nuclear Safety Commission]] (NSC), nor were they used to direct the evacuation. Because a substantial portion of radioactive materials reached ground to the northwest, residents evacuated in this direction were unnecessarily exposed to radiation. According to NSC chief Tetsuya Yamamoto, "It was very regrettable that we didn't share and utilize the information." Itaru Watanabe, from the Science and Technology Policy Bureau, blamed the US for not releasing the data.&lt;ref name="Japan failed to use U.S. radiation data gathered after nuke crisis"/&gt;

Data on the dispersal of radioactive materials were provided to the U.S. forces by the Japanese Ministry for Science a few days after 11 March; however, the data was not shared publicly until the Americans published their map on 23 March, at which point Japan published fallout maps compiled from ground measurements and SPEEDI the same day.&lt;ref name="Earthquake report 447"/&gt; According to Watanabe's testimony before the Diet, the US military was given access to the data "to seek support from them" on how to deal with the nuclear disaster. Although SPEEDI's effectiveness was limited by not knowing the amounts released in the disaster, and thus was considered "unreliable", it was still able to forecast dispersal routes and could have been used to help local governments designate more appropriate evacuation routes.&lt;ref&gt;The Japan Times (17 January 2012) [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2012/01/18/national/u-s-forces-given-speedi-data-early/#.VxWY1EeWkgU U.S. forces given SPEEDI data early]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 June 2012, science minister Hirofumi Hirano stated that his "job was only to measure radiation levels on land" and that the government would study whether disclosure could have helped in the evacuation efforts.&lt;ref name="Earthquake report 447"/&gt;

On 28 June 2012, [[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency]] officials apologized to mayor Yuko Endo of Kawauchi Village for NISA having failed to release the American-produced radiation maps in the first days after the meltdowns. All residents of this village were evacuated after the government designated it a no-entry zone. According to a Japanese government panel, authorities had shown no respect for the lives and dignity of village people. One NISA official apologized for the failure and added that the panel had stressed the importance of disclosure; however, the mayor said that the information would have prevented the evacuation into highly polluted areas, and that apologies a year too late had no meaning.&lt;ref&gt;JIAF (29 June 2012)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1340954689P.pdf Earthequake-report 455: NISA "sorry" for withholding US radiation maps]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, it was revealed that TEPCO officials had been instructed on 14 March 2011 not to describe the reactor damage using the word "meltdown". Officials at that time were aware that 25–55% of the fuel had been damaged, and the threshold for which the term "meltdown" became appropriate (5%) had been greatly exceeded. TEPCO President Naomi Hirose told the media: "I would say it was a cover-up... It’s extremely regrettable.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/06/21/japanese-utility-admits-to-coverup-during-fukushima-nuclear-meltdown.html|title=Japanese utility admits to 'coverup' during Fukushima nuclear meltdown {{!}} Toronto Star|website=thestar.com|access-date=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event rating==
{{Main|Accident rating of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster}}
[[File:Fukushima7.png|thumb|Comparison of radiation levels for different nuclear events]]

The incident was rated 7 on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]] (INES).&lt;ref name="en20110412-4"/&gt; This scale runs from 0, indicating an abnormal situation with no safety consequences, to 7, indicating an accident causing widespread contamination with serious health and environmental effects. Prior to Fukushima, the Chernobyl disaster was the only level 7 event on record, while the [[Three Mile Island accident]] was rated as level 5.

A 2012 analysis of the intermediate and long-lived radioactivity released found about 10–20% of that released from the Chernobyl disaster.&lt;ref name="nature1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iaeaf120411"/&gt; Approximately 15&amp;nbsp;[[Bq|PBq]] of [[caesium-137]] was released,&lt;ref name="tepco2"/&gt; compared with approximately 85&amp;nbsp;PBq of caesium-137 at Chernobyl,&lt;ref name="oecd-nea1"/&gt; indicating the release of {{convert|26.5|kg||sp=us}} of caesium-137.

Unlike Chernobyl, all Japanese reactors were in concrete containment vessels, which limited the release of [[strontium-90]], [[americium-241]], and [[plutonium]], which were among the [[radioisotope]]s released by the earlier incident.&lt;ref name="nature1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oecd-nea1"/&gt;

Some 500&amp;nbsp;PBq of [[iodine-131]] were released,&lt;ref name="tepco2"/&gt; compared to approximately 1,760&amp;nbsp;PBq at Chernobyl.&lt;ref name="oecd-nea1"/&gt; Iodine-131 has a [[half-life]] of 8.02 days, decaying into a stable nuclide. After ten half lives (80.2 days), 99.9% has decayed to [[xenon-131]], a stable isotope.&lt;ref name="terrapub"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{Main|Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster casualties}}
Although there were no deaths from radiation exposure in the immediate aftermath of the incident, there were a number of deaths during the evacuation of the nearby population.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnson|first1=George|title=When Radiation Isn’t the Real Risk|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/science/when-radiation-isnt-the-real-risk.html|accessdate=30 November 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-20160229"/&gt;  As of February 2014, 15,884 deaths were attributed to the earthquake and tsunami.&lt;ref name=cnn140220/&gt;

===Risks from radiation===

Although people in the incident's worst affected areas have a slightly higher risk of developing certain cancers such as [[leukemia]], [[cancer|solid cancers]], [[thyroid cancer]], and [[breast cancer]], very few cancers would be expected as a result of accumulated radiation exposures.&lt;ref name="NatureBrumfiel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fukushima: Fallout of fear"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PRINT - FUKUSHIMA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Rojavin |first1= Y |last2= Seamon |first2= MJ |last3= Tripathi |first3= RS |last4= Papadimos |first4= TJ |last5= Galwankar |first5= S |last6= Kman |first6= N |last7= Cipolla |first7= J |last8= Grossman |first8= MD |last9= Marchigiani |first9= R |last10= Stawicki |first10= SP |date= Apr 2011 |title= Civilian nuclear incidents: An overview of historical, medical, and scientific aspects |url= |journal= J Emerg Trauma Shock |volume= 4 |issue= 2 |pages= 260–72 |doi= 10.4103/0974-2700.82219|pmid= 21769214 |pmc= 3132367 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimated effective doses outside Japan are considered to be below (or far below) the levels regarded as very small by the international radiological protection community.{{sfn|WHO|2013|p=42}}&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Material is identical to hard copy but goes beyond hard copy --&gt; It predicted that populations in the most contaminated areas faced a 70% higher relative risk of developing thyroid cancer for females exposed as infants, and a 7% higher relative risk of leukemia in males exposed as infants and a 6% higher relative risk of breast cancer in females exposed as infants.&lt;ref name="science.time.com"/&gt; One-third of involved emergency workers would have increased cancer risks.&lt;ref name="science.time.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nei-20130301"/&gt; Cancer risks for [[fetus]]es were similar to those in 1 year old infants.{{sfn|WHO|2013|pp=70, 79–80}} The estimated cancer risk to children and adults was lower than it was to infants.{{sfn|WHO|2013|p=13}}

{{Quote|These percentages represent estimated relative increases over the baseline rates and are not absolute risks for developing such cancers.

Five years after the event, the Department of Agriculture from the University of Tokyo (which holds many experimental agricultural research fields around the affected area) has noted that "the fallout was found at the surface of anything exposed to air at the time of the accident.

In February 2018, Japan renewed the export of fish caught off Fukushima's nearshore zone. According to prefecture officials, no seafood had been found with radiation levels exceeding Japan safety standards since April 2015. Thailand is the first country to receive a shipment of fresh fish from Japan's Fukushima prefecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/thailand-receives-fukushimas-first-fish-export-since-2011-nuclear-disaster|website=The Straits Times|title=Thailand receives Fukushima's first fish export since 2011 nuclear disaster|access-date=14 March 2018|date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group campaigning to help prevent global warming has demanded the Food and Drug Administration disclose the name of the importer of fish from Fukushima and of the Japanese restaurants in Bangkok serving it.

In July 2018, a robotic probe has found that radiation levels remain too high for humans to work inside one of the reactor buildings.

===Thyroid screening program===

The World Health Organization stated that a 2013 [[thyroid]] ultrasound screening program was, due to the [[screening (medicine)|screening effect]], likely to lead to an increase in recorded thyroid cases due to early detection of non-[[symptomatic]] disease cases.{{sfn|WHO|2013|pp=87–88}} The overwhelming majority of thyroid growths are benign growths that will never cause symptoms, illness, or death, even if nothing is ever done about the growth. [[Autopsy]] studies on people who died from other causes show that more than one third of adults technically have a thyroid growth/cancer.&lt;ref name="Welch"/&gt; As a precedent, in 1999 in [[South Korea]], the introduction of advanced [[ultrasound]] thyroid examinations resulted in an explosion in the rate of [[benign]] thyroid cancers being detected and needless surgeries occurring.&lt;ref name="fukushimainform.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fukushimainform.ca/2016/03/06/screening-effect-examining-thyroid-cancers-found-in-fukushima-children/|title=Screening effect? Examining thyroid cancers found in Fukushima children|date=6 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the death rate from thyroid cancer has remained the same.&lt;ref name="fukushimainform.ca"/&gt;

According to the Tenth Report of the Fukushima Prefecture Health Management Survey released in February 2013, more than 40% of children screened around Fukushima prefecture were diagnosed with thyroid nodules or cysts. Ultrasonographic detectable thyroid nodules and cysts are extremely common and can be found at a frequency of up to 67% in various studies.&lt;ref name="Very high prevalence of thyroid nodules detected by high frequency (13 MHz) ultrasound examination."&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19601965 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2362.2009.02162.x |volume=39 |issue=8 |title=Very high prevalence of thyroid nodules detected by high frequency (13 MHz) ultrasound examination |year=2009 |journal=Eur.

A [[Russia Today]] report into the matter was highly misleading.&lt;ref name="Russia Times"/&gt; Fukushima Medical University give the number of children diagnosed with thyroid cancer, as of December 2013, as 33 and concluded "it is unlikely that these cancers were caused by the exposure from I-131 from the nuclear power plant accident in March 2011".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fmu.ac.jp/radiationhealth/workshop201402/presentation/Co-Chairs_Summary_E.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209225613/http://www.fmu.ac.jp/radiationhealth/workshop201402/presentation/Co-Chairs_Summary_E.pdf |archivedate=9 February 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, 137 children from the Fukushima Prefecture were described as either being diagnosed with or showing signs of developing thyroid cancer. The study's lead author Toshihide Tsuda from [[Okayama University]] stated that the increased detection could not be accounted for by attributing it to the [[screening (medicine)|screening effect]]. He described the screening results to be "20 times to 50 times what would be normally expected."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |title= Experts link higher incidence of children's cancer to Fukushima radiation|url= http://www.sciencealert.com/experts-link-higher-incidence-of-children-s-cancer-to-fukushima-radiation|website= ScienceAlert|access-date= 15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2015, the number had increased to 166 children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20160307/p2a/00m/0na/022000c|title=Experts divided on causes of high thyroid cancer rates among Fukushima children – The Mainichi|language=en-US|access-date=6 July 2016|newspaper=Mainichi Daily News|date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite his paper being widely reported by the media,&lt;ref name="fukushimainform.ca"/&gt; an undermining error, according to teams of other epidemiologists who point out Tsuda's remarks are fatally wrong, is that Tsuda did an [[apples and oranges]] comparison by comparing the Fukushima surveys, which uses advanced ultrasound devices that detect otherwise unnoticeable thyroid growths, with data from traditional non-advanced clinical examinations, to arrive at his "20 to 50 times what would be expected" conclusion. In the critical words of epidemiologist Richard Wakeford, “It is inappropriate to compare the data from the Fukushima screening program with cancer registry data from the rest of Japan where there is, in general, no such large-scale screening,”. Wakeford's criticism was one of seven other author's letters that were published criticizing Tsuda's paper.&lt;ref name="fukushimainform.ca"/&gt; According to Takamura, another epidemiologist, who examined the results of small scale advanced ultrasound tests on Japanese children not near Fukushima, "The prevalence of thyroid cancer [using the same detection technology] does not differ meaningfully from that in Fukushima Prefecture,”.&lt;ref name="fukushimainform.ca"/&gt;

In 2016 Ohira et al. conducted a study cross-comparing thyroid cancer patients from Fukushima prefecture evacuees with rates of Thyroid cancer in from those outside of the evacuation zone. Ohira et al. found that "The duration between accident and thyroid examination was not associated with thyroid cancer prevalence. There were no significant associations between individual external doses and prevalence of thyroid cancer. External radiation dose was not associated with thyroid cancer prevalence among Fukushima children within the first 4 years after the nuclear accident.."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ohira|first=Tetsuya et. al.|date=August 2016|title=Comparison of childhood thyroid cancer prevalence among 3 areas based on external radiation dose after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident|pmc=5008539|journal=Medicine|volume=95|issue=35|pages=e4472 PubMed|pmid=27583855|doi=10.1097/MD.0000000000004472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 publication by Yamashita et al. also concluded that Thyroid cancer rate differences can be attributed to the screening effect. They noted that the mean age of the patients at the time of the accident was 10–15 years, while no cases were found in children from the ages of 0-5 who would have been most susceptible. Yamashita et al. thus conclude that "In any case, the individual prognosis cannot be accurately determined at the time of FNAC at present. It is therefore urgent to search not only for intraoperative and postoperative prognostic factors but also for predictive prognostic factors at the FNAC/preoperative stage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yamashita|first=Shunichi|display-authors=etal|date=1 January 2018|title=Lessons from Fukushima: Latest Findings of Thyroid Cancer After the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant Accident|url=|journal=Thyroid|volume=28|issue=1|pages=11–22 PubMed|doi=10.1089/thy.2017.0283|pmid=28954584|pmc=5770131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thyroid cancer]] is one of the most survivable cancers, with an approximate [[list of cancer mortality rates in the United States|94% survival rate]] after first diagnosis. That rate increases to a nearly 100% survival rate if caught early.&lt;ref name="acc"/&gt;

====Chernobyl comparison====
{{Main|Comparison of Fukushima and Chernobyl nuclear accidents}}
Radiation deaths at Chernobyl were also statistically undetectable. Only 0.1% of the 110,645 Ukraninian cleanup workers, included in a 20-year study out of over 500,000 former Soviet clean up workers, had as of 2012 developed leukemia, although not all cases resulted from the accident.&lt;ref name="Brumfiel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zablotska"/&gt;

Data from Chernobyl showed that there was a steady then sharp increase in thyroid cancer rates following the disaster in 1986, but whether this data can be directly compared to Fukushima is yet to be determined.&lt;ref name="hormones.gr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rt.com"/&gt;

Chernobyl thyroid cancer incidence rates did not begin to increase above the prior baseline value of about 0.7 cases per 100,000 people per year until 1989 to 1991, 3–5 years after the incident in both adolescent and child age groups.&lt;ref name="hormones.gr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rt.com"/&gt; The rate reached its highest point so far, of about 11 cases per 100,000 in the decade of the 2000s, approximately 14 years after the accident.&lt;ref name="hormones.gr"/&gt; From 1989 to 2005, an excess of 4,000 children and adolescent cases of thyroid cancer were observed. Nine of these had died as of 2005, a 99% survival rate.&lt;ref name="Chernobyl: the true scale of the accident. 20 Years Later a UN Report Provides Definitive Answers and Ways to Repair Lives"/&gt;

===Effects on evacuees===
In the former [[Soviet Union]], many patients with negligible radioactive exposure after the Chernobyl disaster displayed extreme anxiety about radiation exposure. They developed many [[psychosomatic]] problems, including [[radiophobia]] along with an increase in [[fatalism|fatalistic]] [[alcoholism]]. As Japanese health and radiation specialist Shunichi Yamashita noted:&lt;ref name="spie78"/&gt;
{{Quote|We know from Chernobyl that the [[psychological]] consequences are enormous. Life expectancy of the evacuees dropped from 65 to 58 years – not because of cancer, but because of [[depression (mood)|depression]], alcoholism, and [[suicide]]. Relocation is not easy, the [[stress (psychological)|stress]] is very big. We must not only track those problems, but also treat them. Otherwise people will feel they are just guinea pigs in our research.&lt;ref name=spie78/&gt;}}

A survey by the [[Iitate, Fukushima|Iitate]] local government obtained responses from approximately 1,743 evacuees within the evacuation zone. The survey showed that many residents are experiencing growing frustration, instability, and an inability to return to their earlier lives. Sixty percent of respondents stated that their health and the health of their families had deteriorated after evacuating, while 39.9% reported feeling more irritated compared to before the disaster.&lt;ref name="main2012"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Summarizing all responses to questions related to evacuees' current family status, one-third of all surveyed families live apart from their children, while 50.1% live away from other family members (including elderly parents) with whom they lived before the disaster. The survey also showed that 34.7% of the evacuees have suffered salary cuts of 50% or more since the outbreak of the nuclear disaster. A total of 36.8% reported a lack of sleep, while 17.9% reported smoking or drinking more than before they evacuated.&lt;ref name=main2012/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stress often manifests in physical ailments, including behavioral changes such as poor dietary choices, lack of exercise, and sleep deprivation. Survivors, including some who lost homes, villages, and family members, were found likely to face mental health and physical challenges. Much of the stress came from lack of information and from relocation.&lt;ref name="Japan's Post-Fukushima Earthquake Health Woes Go Beyond Radiation Effects"/&gt;

A survey computed that of some 300,000 evacuees, approximately 1,600 deaths related to the evacuation conditions, such as living in [[prefabricated home|temporary housing]] and hospital closures that had occurred as of August 2013, a number comparable to the 1,599 deaths directly caused by the earthquake and tsunami in the Prefecture. The exact causes of these evacuation related deaths were not specified, because according to the municipalities, that would hinder relatives applying for compensation.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mainichi.jp"/&gt;

In a 2017 [[risk analysis]], relying on the metric of [[Years of potential life lost|potential months of life lost]], it determined that unlike Chernobyl, "relocation was unjustified for the 160,000 people relocated after Fukushima" especially considering 1,600 deaths occurred due to the stressful evacuation conditions, when the potential future deaths from exposure to radiation around Fukushima, would have been much less, if the alternative of the [[shelter in place]] protocol had instead been deployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/11/171120085453.htm|title=Homes should not be abandoned after a big nuclear accident, study suggests|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=P.J|title=J-value assessment of relocation measures following the nuclear power plant accidents at Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi|journal=Process Safety and Environmental Protection|volume=112|pages=16–49|date=November 2017|doi=10.1016/j.psep.2017.03.012|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957582017300782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insurance===

According to [[reinsurance|reinsurer]] [[Munich Re]], the private insurance industry will not be significantly affected by the disaster.&lt;ref name="munichre"/&gt; [[Swiss Re]] similarly stated, "Coverage for nuclear facilities in Japan excludes earthquake shock, fire following earthquake and tsunami, for both physical damage and liability. Swiss Re believes that the incident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant is unlikely to result in a significant direct loss for the property &amp; casualty insurance industry."&lt;ref name="swissre14"/&gt; {{Failed verification|date=October 2014}}

===Compensation===
The amount of compensation to be paid by TEPCO is expected to reach 7 trillion yen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= UPDATE 1-Fukushima operator's mounting legal woes to fuel nuclear opposition|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/japan-nuclear-tepco-legal-idUSL3N10S2GJ20150817|newspaper= Reuters|date= 17 August 2015|access-date= 2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy policy implications===
[[File:Nuclear power plant construction.jpg|thumb|The number of nuclear power plant constructions started each year worldwide, from 1954 to 2013. Following an increase in new constructions from 2007 to 2010, there was a decline after the Fukushima nuclear disaster.]]

By March 2012, one year after the disaster, all but two of Japan's nuclear reactors had been shut down; some had been damaged by the quake and tsunami. Authority to restart the others after scheduled maintenance throughout the year was given to local governments, who in all cases decided against. According to ''[[The Japan Times]]'', the disaster changed the national debate over energy policy almost overnight. "By shattering the government's long-pitched safety myth about nuclear power, the crisis dramatically raised public awareness about energy use and sparked strong [[anti-nuclear]] sentiment". An energy white paper, approved by the Japanese Cabinet in October 2011, says "public confidence in safety of nuclear power was greatly damaged" by the disaster and called for a reduction in the nation's reliance on nuclear power. It also omitted a section on nuclear power expansion that was in the previous year's policy review.&lt;ref name="Nuclear Promotion Dropped in Japan Energy Policy After Fukushima"/&gt;

Michael Banach, the current [[Holy See|Vatican]] representative to the IAEA, told a conference in Vienna in September 2011 that the disaster created new concerns about the safety of nuclear plants globally. Auxiliary Bishop of Osaka Michael Goro Matsuura said this incident should cause Japan and other countries to abandon nuclear projects. He called on the worldwide Christian community to support this anti-nuclear campaign. Statements from Bishops' conferences in Korea and the Philippines called on their governments to abandon atomic power. Author [[Kenzaburō Ōe]], who received a [[Nobel prize]] in [[literature]], urged Japan to abandon its reactors.&lt;ref name="Kenzaburo Oe, Nobel Winner Urges Japan To Abandon Nuclear Power"/&gt;

The nuclear plant closest to the [[epicenter]] of the earthquake, the [[Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant]], successfully withstood the cataclysm. According to [[Reuters]] it may serve as a "trump card" for the nuclear lobby, providing evidence that it is possible for a correctly designed and operated nuclear facility to withstand such a cataclysm.&lt;ref name="reuters15"/&gt;

The loss of 30% of the country's generating capacity led to much greater reliance on [[liquified natural gas]] and [[coal]].&lt;ref name="Fukushima Starts Long Road To Recovery"/&gt; Unusual conservation measures were undertaken. In the immediate aftermath, nine prefectures served by TEPCO experienced power rationing.&lt;ref name="Neon city goes dim as power shortage threatens traffic lights and telephones in Tokyo"/&gt; The government asked major companies to reduce power consumption by 15%, and some shifted their weekends to weekdays to smooth power demand.&lt;ref name="tulsaworld"/&gt; Converting to a nuclear-free gas and [[oil]] energy economy would cost tens of billions of dollars in annual fees. One estimate is that even including the disaster, more lives would have been lost if Japan had used coal or gas plants instead of nuclear.&lt;ref name="Dennis Normile 395"/&gt;

Many political activists have begun calling for a phase-out of nuclear power in Japan, including [[Amory Lovins]], who claimed, "Japan is poor in ''fuels'', but is the richest of all major industrial countries in renewable ''energy'' that can meet the entire long-term energy needs of an energy-efficient Japan, at lower cost and risk than current plans. Japanese industry can do it faster than anyone – ''if'' Japanese policymakers acknowledge and allow it".&lt;ref name="Amory Lovins 2011"/&gt; [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] asserted that Japan could have exploited instead its [[renewable energy]] base. Japan has a total of "324&amp;nbsp;GW of achievable potential in the form of onshore and offshore [[wind turbine]]s (222&amp;nbsp;GW), [[geothermal power]] plants (70 &amp;nbsp;GW), additional hydroelectric capacity (26.5&amp;nbsp;GW), solar energy (4.8&amp;nbsp;GW) and agricultural residue (1.1&amp;nbsp;GW)."&lt;ref name="bks2011"/&gt;

In contrast, others have said that the zero mortality rate from the Fukushima incident confirms their opinion that [[nuclear fission]] is the only viable option available to replace [[fossil fuels]]. Journalist [[George Monbiot]] wrote "Why Fukushima made me stop worrying and love nuclear power." In it he said, "As a result of the disaster at Fukushima, I am no longer nuclear-neutral. I now support the technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/21/pro-nuclear-japan-fukushima|title=Why Fukushima made me stop worrying and love nuclear power|author=George Monbiot|newspaper=the Guardian|accessdate=12 June 2015|date=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monbiot.com/2011/04/13/why-this-matters/|title=Why This Matters|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued, "A crappy old plant with inadequate safety features was hit by a monster earthquake and a vast tsunami. The electricity supply failed, knocking out the cooling system. The reactors began to explode and melt down. The disaster exposed a familiar legacy of poor design and corner-cutting. Yet, as far as we know, no one has yet received a lethal dose of radiation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monbiot.com/2011/08/08/the-moral-case-for-nuclear-power/|title=The Moral Case for Nuclear Power|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monbiot.com/2011/11/22/how-the-greens-were-misled/|title=How the Greens Were Misled|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responses to Monbiot noted his "false calculation that [nuclear powered electricity] is needed, that it can work economically, and that it can solve its horrific waste, decommissioning and proliferation-security pitfalls ... [along with human] safety, health and indeed human psychology issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/24/renewables-nuclear-fukushima-japan-environment|author=Jeremy Leggett|title=Response: George Monbiot is wrong.

In September 2011, [[Mycle Schneider]] said that the disaster can be understood as a unique chance "to get it right" on [[energy policy]]. "Germany – with its nuclear phase-out decision based on a [[renewable energy in Germany|renewable energy]] program – and Japan – having suffered a painful shock but possessing unique technical capacities and societal discipline – can be at the forefront of an authentic paradigm shift toward a truly sustainable, low-carbon and nuclear-free energy policy."&lt;ref name="Fukushima crisis: Can Japan be at the forefront of an authentic paradigm shift?"/&gt;

On the other hand, climate and energy scientists [[James Hansen]], [[Ken Caldeira]], [[Kerry Emanuel]], and [[Tom Wigley]] released an open letter calling on world leaders to support development of safer nuclear power systems, stating "There is no credible path to climate stabilization that does not include a substantial role for nuclear power." &lt;ref name="Top climate change scientists' letter to policy influencers"/&gt; In December 2014, an open letter from 75 climate and energy scientists on the website of pro-nuclear advocate [[Barry Brook (scientist)|Barry Brook]] asserted "nuclear power has lowest impact on wildlife and ecosystems – which is what we need given the dire state of the world’s biodiversity."&lt;ref name="It’s time for environmentalists to give nuclear a fair go"/&gt; Brook's advocacy for nuclear power has been challenged by opponents of nuclear industries, including environmentalist [[Jim Green (activist)|Jim Green]] of [[Friends of the Earth Australia|Friends of the Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://newmatilda.com/2012/03/12/nuclear-power-isnt-green-bullet|title = Nuclear power isn't a green bullet|last = Green|first = Jim|date = 12 March 2012|work = |access-date = 9 February 2015|publisher = NewMatilda.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brook has described the [[Australian Greens]] political party (SA Branch) and [[Australian Youth Climate Coalition]] as "sad" and "increasingly irrelevant" after they expressed their opposition to nuclear industrial development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bravenewclimate.com/2015/02/08/south-australia-announces-royal-commission-into-nuclear-energy/|title = South Australia announces Royal Commission into Nuclear Energy|date = 8 February 2015|accessdate = 10 February 2015|website = Brave New Climate|publisher = |last = Brook|first = Barry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2011|09}}, Japan planned to build a pilot offshore [[floating wind turbine|floating wind farm]], with six 2 MW turbines, off the [[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima coast]].&lt;ref name="bb20110916"/&gt; The first became operational in November 2013.&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt; After the evaluation phase is complete in 2016, "Japan plans to build as many as 80 floating wind turbines off Fukushima by 2020."&lt;ref name=bb20110916/&gt; In 2012, Prime Minister Kan said the disaster made it clear to him that "Japan needs to dramatically reduce its dependence on nuclear power, which supplied 30% of its electricity before the crisis, and has turned him into a believer of renewable energy".{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Sales of solar panels in Japan rose 30.7% to 1,296 MW in 2011, helped by a government scheme to promote renewable energy. [[Canadian Solar]] received financing for its plans to build a factory in Japan with capacity of 150 MW, scheduled to begin production in 2014.&lt;ref name="Canadian Solar Signs Loan Agreement For Japan Development"/&gt;

As of September 2012, the [[Los Angeles Times]] reported that "Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda acknowledged that the vast majority of Japanese support the zero option on nuclear power",&lt;ref name="In wake of Fukushima disaster, Japan to end nuclear power by 2030s"/&gt; and Prime Minister Noda and the Japanese government announced plans to make the country nuclear-free by the 2030s. They announced the end to construction of nuclear power plants and a 40-year limit on existing nuclear plants. Nuclear plant restarts must meet safety standards of the new independent regulatory authority. The plan requires investing $500 billion over 20 years.&lt;ref name="After Fukushima, Nuclear Power on Collision Course With Japanese Public"/&gt;

On 16 December 2012, Japan held its [[Japanese election, 2012|general election]]. The [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) had a clear victory, with [[Shinzō Abe]] as the new [[prime minister of Japan|Prime Minister]]. Abe supported nuclear power, saying that leaving the plants closed was costing the country 4 trillion yen per year in higher costs.&lt;ref name="asahi16"/&gt; The comment came after [[Junichiro Koizumi]], who chose Abe to succeed him as premier, made a recent statement to urge the government to take a stance against using nuclear power.&lt;ref name="houseofjapan"/&gt; A survey on local mayors by the [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] newspaper in January 2013 found that most of them from cities hosting nuclear plants would agree to restarting the reactors, provided the government could guarantee their safety.&lt;ref name="Most Japan cities hosting nuclear plants OK restart: survey"/&gt; More than 30,000 people marched on 2 June 2013, in Tokyo against restarting nuclear power plants. Marchers had gathered more than 8 million petition signatures opposing nuclear power.&lt;ref name="60,000 protest Japan's plan to restart nuclear power plants"/&gt;

In October 2013, it was reported that TEPCO and eight other Japanese power companies were paying approximately 3.6 trillion [[yen]] (37 billion [[dollars]]) more in combined imported fossil fuel costs compared to 2010, before the accident, to make up for the missing power.&lt;ref name="Japan's Fuel Costs May Rise to 7.5 Trillion Yen, Meti Estimates"/&gt;

From 2016 to 2018 the nation fired up at least eight new [[coal power plant]]s. Plans for an additional 36 coal stations over the next decade are the biggest planned coal power expansion in any developed nation. The new national energy plan that would have coal provide 26% of Japan's electricity in 2030, presents the abandoning of a previous goal of reducing coal's share to 10%. The coal revival is seen as having alarming implications for air pollution and Japan's ability to meet its pledges to cut greenhouse gases by 80% by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6388/476|title=Bucking global trends, Japan again embraces coal power|first=Dennis|last=Normile|date=4 May 2018|journal=Science|volume=360|issue=6388|pages=476–77|via=science.sciencemag.org|doi=10.1126/science.360.6388.476|pmid=29724935|bibcode=2018Sci...360..476N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equipment, facility, and operational changes===

A number of [[nuclear reactor safety system]] lessons emerged from the incident. The most obvious was that in tsunami-prone areas, a power station's [[sea wall]] must be adequately tall and robust.&lt;ref name=":182"/&gt; At the [[Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant]], closer to the epicenter of 11 March earthquake and tsunami,&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt; the sea wall was {{Convert|14|m||sp=us}} tall and successfully withstood the tsunami, preventing serious damage and radioactivity releases.&lt;ref name="iaea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="www17"/&gt;

Nuclear power station operators around the world began to install [[Passive autocatalytic recombiner|Passive Autocatalytic hydrogen Recombiners]] ("PARs"), which do not require electricity to operate.&lt;ref name="world-nuclear-news"/&gt;&lt;ref name="business-standard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nuclear-engineering-journal"/&gt; PARs work much like the [[catalytic converter]] on the exhaust of a car to turn potentially explosive gases such as hydrogen into water. Had such devices been positioned at the top of Fukushima I's reactor buildings, where hydrogen gas collected, the explosions would not have occurred and the releases of radioactive isotopes would arguably have been much less.&lt;ref name="spectrum 24hr"/&gt;

Unpowered filtering systems on [[containment building]] vent lines, known as [[Filtered Containment Venting System]]s (FCVS), can safely catch radioactive materials and thereby allow reactor core depressurization, with steam and hydrogen venting with minimal radioactivity emissions.&lt;ref name="spectrum 24hr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nuclear chief: U.S. plants safer after Japan crisis. 10 March 2013"/&gt; Filtration using an external water tank system is the most common established system in European countries, with the water tank positioned outside the [[containment building]].&lt;ref name="Vents and Filtering Strategies Come to Forefront in Fukushima Response Nuclear Energy Insight. Fall 2012"/&gt; In October 2013, the owners of [[Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant|Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power station]] began installing wet filters and other safety systems, with completion anticipated in 2014.&lt;ref name="TEPCO implements new safety measures in bid to restart Niigata reactors"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant shown to reporters"/&gt;

For [[generation II reactor]]s located in flood or tsunami prone areas, a 3+ day supply of back-up batteries has become an informal industry standard.&lt;ref name="power-eng"/&gt;&lt;ref name="businesswire"/&gt; Another change is to harden the location of back-up diesel generator rooms with water-tight, blast-resistant doors and [[heat sink]]s, similar to those used by [[nuclear submarine]]s.&lt;ref name="spectrum 24hr"/&gt; The oldest operating nuclear power station in the world, [[Beznau Nuclear Power Plant|Beznau]], which has been operating since 1969, has a 'Notstand' hardened building designed to support all of its systems independently for 72&amp;nbsp;hours in the event of an earthquake or severe flooding. This system was built prior to Fukushima Daiichi.&lt;ref name="woody"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A PRA Practioner Looks at the Fukushima Daiichi Accident"/&gt;

Upon a [[power outage|station blackout]], similar to the one that occurred after Fukushima's back-up battery supply was exhausted,&lt;ref name="2012 20th International Conference on Nuclear Engineering and the ASME 2012 Power Conference"/&gt; many constructed [[Generation III reactor]]s adopt the principle of [[passive nuclear safety]]. They take advantage of [[convection]] (hot water tends to rise) and [[gravity]] (water tends to fall) to ensure an adequate supply of cooling water to handle the [[decay heat]], without the use of pumps.&lt;ref name="power-engiii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nuclear Science and Techniques 24 (2013) 040601 Study on the long-term passive cooling extension of AP1000 reactor"/&gt;

As the crisis unfolded, the Japanese government sent a request for robots developed by the U.S. military. The robots went into the plants and took pictures to help assess the situation, but they couldn't perform the full range of tasks usually carried out by human workers.&lt;ref name="swissre"/&gt; The Fukushima disaster illustrated that robots lacked sufficient dexterity and robustness to perform critical tasks. In response to this shortcoming, a series of competitions were hosted by [[DARPA]] to accelerate the development of [[humanoid robot]]s that could supplement relief efforts.&lt;ref name="robots"&gt;{{cite news |author1     = Seiji Iwata |author2     = Ryuichi Kanari |date        = 26 May 2011 |title       = Japanese robots long gone before Fukushima accident |url         = http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201105260215 |newspaper   = [[Asahi Shimbun]] |accessdate  = 27 August 2014 |deadurl     = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140903061944/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201105260215 |archivedate = 3 September 2014 |df          = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DARPA Robotics Challenge|url=http://www.theroboticschallenge.org/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428005028/http://www.darparoboticschallenge.org/|archivedate=28 April 2016 |website=DRC |publisher=DARPA |accessdate=27 April 2016 |deadurl=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==

===Japan===
{{Main|Japanese reaction to Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster}}
[[File:Towns evacuated around Fukushima on April 11th, 2011.png|thumb|Japan towns, villages, and cities in and around the Daiichi nuclear plant exclusion zone. The {{Convert|20 and 30|km||abbr=on|sp=us}} areas had evacuation and [[shelter in place]] orders, and additional administrative districts that had an evacuation order are highlighted. However, the above map's factual accuracy is called into question as only the southern portion of [[Kawamata, Fukushima|Kawamata]] district had evacuation orders. More accurate maps are available.&lt;ref name="Areas to which evacuation orders have been issued" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Designating and Rearranging the Areas of Evacuation (pg 7)"/&gt;]]

Japanese authorities later admitted to lax standards and poor oversight.&lt;ref name="reuters2011"/&gt; They took fire for their handling of the emergency and engaged in a pattern of withholding and denying damaging information.&lt;ref name=reuters2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="japantimes11"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytaug/&gt;&lt;ref name=bellaug/&gt; Authorities allegedly{{dubious|date=June 2015}} wanted to "limit the size of costly and disruptive evacuations in land-scarce Japan and to avoid public questioning of the politically powerful nuclear industry". Public anger emerged over an "official campaign{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}{{failed verification|date=June 2015}} to play down the scope of the accident and the potential health risks".&lt;ref name="nytaug"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bellaug"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ibtimes18"/&gt;

In many cases, the Japanese government's reaction was judged to be less than adequate by many in Japan, especially those who were living in the region. Decontamination equipment was slow to be made available and then slow to be utilized. As late as June 2011, even rainfall continued to cause fear and uncertainty in eastern Japan because of its possibility of washing radioactivity from the sky back to earth.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

To assuage fears, the government enacted an order to [[radioactive contamination#Decontamination|decontaminate]] over a hundred areas with a level contamination greater than or equivalent to one [[millisievert]]{{clarify|reason=One millisievert per what?|date=April 2015}} of radiation. This is a much lower threshold than is necessary for protecting health. The government also sought to address the lack of education on the effects of radiation and the extent to which the average person was exposed.&lt;ref name="international"/&gt;

Previously a proponent of building more reactors, Kan took an increasingly [[anti-nuclear]] stance following the disaster. In May 2011, he ordered the aging [[Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant]] closed over earthquake and tsunami concerns, and said he would freeze building plans. In July 2011, Kan said, "Japan should reduce and eventually eliminate its dependence on nuclear energy".&lt;ref name="Japan Premier Wants Shift Away From Nuclear Power"/&gt; In October 2013, he said that if the worst-case scenario had been realized, 50 million people within a {{Convert|250|km||sp=us|adj=on}} radius would have had to evacuate.&lt;ref name="Encountering the Fukushima Daiichi Accident"/&gt;

On 22 August 2011, a government spokesman mentioned the possibility that some areas around the plant "could stay for some decades a forbidden zone". According to Yomiuri Shimbun the Japanese government was planning to buy some properties from civilians to store waste and materials that had become radioactive after the accidents.&lt;ref name="www19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Chiaki Takahashi, Japan's foreign minister, criticized foreign media reports as excessive. He added that he could "understand the concerns of foreign countries over recent developments at the nuclear plant, including the [[radioactive contamination]] of seawater".&lt;ref name="jaif_45"/&gt;

Due to frustration with TEPCO and the Japanese government "providing differing, confusing, and at times contradictory, information on critical health issues"&lt;ref name="aljazeera"/&gt; a citizen's group called "[[Safecast (organization)|Safecast]]" recorded detailed radiation level data in Japan.&lt;ref name="safecast"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Volunteers Crowdsource Radiation Monitoring to Map Potential Risk on Every Street in Japan"/&gt; The Japanese government "does not consider nongovernment readings to be authentic". The group uses off-the-shelf [[Geiger counter]] equipment. A simple [[Geiger counter]] is a [[radioactive contamination|contamination]] meter and not a dose rate meter. The response differs too much between different radioisotopes to permit a simple GM tube for dose rate measurements when more than one radioisotope is present. A thin metal shield is needed around a GM tube to provide energy compensation to enable it to be used for dose rate measurements. For gamma emitters either an ionization chamber, a gamma spectrometer or an energy compensated GM tube are required. Members of the Air Monitoring station facility at the Department of Nuclear Engineering at the [[University of Berkeley]], California have tested many environmental samples in Northern California.&lt;ref name="berkeley"/&gt;

===International===

[[File:RCEvacFlight.JPG|thumb|Evacuation flight departs Misawa]]
[[File:ChopperDecon2011.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Navy humanitarian flight undergoes radioactive decontamination]]

The international reaction to the disaster was diverse and widespread. Many inter-governmental agencies immediately offered help, often on an ad hoc basis. Responders included IAEA, [[World Meteorological Organization]] and the Preparatory Commission for the [[Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization]].&lt;ref name="14 March 2011"/&gt;

In May 2011, UK chief inspector of nuclear installations Mike Weightman traveled to Japan as the lead of an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) expert mission. The main finding of this mission, as reported to the IAEA ministerial conference that month, was that risks associated with tsunamis in several sites in Japan had been underestimated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grimes|first1=Robin|title=The UK Response to Fukushima and Anglo-Japanese Relations|journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy|date=16 June 2014|volume=3|issue=2|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2014/uk-response-fukushima-and-anglo-japanese-relations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said the Japanese nuclear disaster "caused deep public anxiety throughout the world and damaged confidence in nuclear power".&lt;ref name="IAEA sees slow nuclear growth post Japan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lesechos"/&gt; Following the disaster, it was reported in ''The Economist'' that the IAEA halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035.&lt;ref name="economist-20110428"/&gt;

In the aftermath, Germany accelerated plans to close its [[nuclear power]] reactors and decided to phase the rest out by 2022.&lt;ref name="Merkel se despide de lo nuclear y anuncia una revolución en renovables"/&gt; Italy held a national referendum, in which 94 percent voted against the government's plan to build new nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name="Italy nuclear: Berlusconi accepts referendum blow"/&gt; In France, President Hollande announced the intention of the government to reduce nuclear usage by one third. So far, however, the government has only earmarked one power station for closure – the aging plant at Fessenheim on the German border – which prompted some to question the government's commitment to Hollande's promise. Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg is on record as saying that Fessenheim will be the only nuclear power station to close. On a visit to China in December 2014 he reassured his audience that nuclear energy was a "sector of the future" and would continue to contribute "at least 50%" of France's electricity output.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25674581|title=France struggles to cut down on nuclear power|newspaper=BBC News|accessdate=12 June 2015|date=2014-01-11|last1=Broomby|first1=Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another member of Hollande's Socialist Party, the MP [[Christian Bataille]], said that Hollande announced the nuclear curb to secure the backing of his Green coalition partners in parliament.&lt;ref name="France struggles to cut down on nuclear power"/&gt;

Nuclear power plans were not abandoned in Malaysia, the Philippines, Kuwait, and Bahrain, or radically changed, as in Taiwan. China suspended its nuclear development program briefly, but restarted it shortly afterwards. The initial plan had been to increase the nuclear contribution from 2 to 4 percent of electricity by 2020, with an escalating program after that. [[Renewable energy]] supplies 17 percent of China's electricity, 16% of which is [[hydroelectricity]]. China plans to triple its nuclear energy output to 2020, and triple it again between 2020 and 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/country-profiles/countries-a-f/china--nuclear-power/|title=China Nuclear Power – Chinese Nuclear Energy|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New nuclear projects were proceeding in some countries. KPMG reports 653 new nuclear facilities planned or proposed for completion by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/nuclear-power-role-in-shaping-energy-policies-v3.pdf|title=Insights|date=20 September 2018|website=KPMG}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2050, China hopes to have 400–500 gigawatts of nuclear capacity – 100 times more than it has now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/10/why-china-will-go-all-in-on-nuclear-power/|title=Why China Will Go All-In on Nuclear Power|author1=Shannon Tiezzi |author2=The Diplomat |work=The Diplomat|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative Government of the United Kingdom is planning a major nuclear expansion despite widespread public objection.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} So is Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/plans-for-new-reactors-worldwide.aspx |title=Plans For New Reactors Worldwide |publisher= [[World Nuclear Association]] |accessdate=23 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; India is also pressing ahead with a large nuclear program, as is South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries-O-S/South-Korea/|title=Nuclear Power in South Korea|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian Vice President M Hamid Ansari said in 2012 that "nuclear energy is the only option" for expanding India's energy supplies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/latest-news/nuclear-energy-only-option-before-country-ansari/|title=Nuclear energy only option before country: Ansari|date=20 October 2012|work=The Indian Express|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Prime Minister Modi announced in 2014 that India intended to build 10 more nuclear reactors in a collaboration with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ibtimes.co.in/tv/modi-india-to-build-10-more-nuclear-reactors-with-russia-28373 |title= Modi: India to build 10 more nuclear reactors with Russia |work= International Business Times |date= 12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigations===
Three investigations into the Fukushima disaster showed the man-made nature of the catastrophe and its roots in [[regulatory capture]] associated with a "network of corruption, collusion, and nepotism."&lt;ref name="After Fukushima: A Survey of Corruption in the Global Nuclear Power Industry"/&gt;&lt;ref name=king12/&gt; Regulatory capture refers to the "situation where regulators charged with promoting the public interest defer to the wishes and advance the agenda of the industry or sector they ostensibly regulate." Those with a vested interest in specific policy or regulatory outcomes lobby regulators and influence their choices and actions. Regulatory capture explains why some of the risks of operating nuclear power reactors in Japan were systematically downplayed and mismanaged so as to compromise operational safety.&lt;ref name="king12"/&gt;

Many reports say that the government shares blame with the regulatory agency for not heeding warnings and for not ensuring the independence of the oversight function.&lt;ref name="Japan's triple disaster: Governance and the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crises"/&gt; The New York Times said that the Japanese nuclear regulatory system sided with and promoted the nuclear industry because of [[amakudari]] ('descent from heaven') in which senior regulators accepted high paying jobs at companies they once oversaw. To protect their potential future position in the industry, regulators sought to avoid taking positions that upset or embarrass the companies. TEPCO's position as the largest electrical utility in Japan made it the most desirable position for retiring regulators.

====NAIIC====
{{Main|National Diet of Japan Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission}}
The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission (NAIIC) was the first independent investigation commission by the [[Diet of Japan|National Diet]] in the 66-year history of Japan's constitutional government.

Fukushima "cannot be regarded as a natural disaster," the NAIIC panel's chairman, Tokyo University professor emeritus [[Kiyoshi Kurokawa]], wrote in the inquiry report. "It was a profoundly man-made disaster – that could and should have been foreseen and prevented. And its effects could have been mitigated by a more effective human response."&lt;ref name="Bloomberg20120705"/&gt; "Governments, regulatory authorities and Tokyo Electric Power [TEPCO] lacked a sense of responsibility to protect people's lives and society," the Commission said. "They effectively betrayed the nation's right to be safe from nuclear accidents.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120705"/&gt;

The Commission recognized that the affected residents were still struggling and facing grave concerns, including the "health effects of radiation exposure, displacement, the dissolution of families, disruption of their lives and lifestyles and the contamination of vast areas of the environment".

====Investigation Committee====
{{Main|Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company}}
The purpose of the [[Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company|Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations]] (ICANPS) was to identify the disaster's causes and propose policies designed to minimize the damage and prevent the recurrence of similar incidents.&lt;ref name="Official website of the Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company"/&gt; The 10 member, government-appointed panel included scholars, journalists, lawyers, and engineers.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120723"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NTI20120723"/&gt; It was supported by public prosecutors and government experts.&lt;ref name="WSJ20120723"/&gt; and released its final, 448-page&lt;ref name="BBW20120723"/&gt; investigation report on 23 July 2012.&lt;ref name="Asahi20120723"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN20120723"/&gt;

The panel's report faulted an inadequate legal system for nuclear crisis management, a crisis-command disarray caused by the government and TEPCO, and possible excess meddling on the part of the Prime Minister's office in the crisis' early stage.&lt;ref name="JapanTimes20120724"/&gt; The panel concluded that a culture of complacency about nuclear safety and poor crisis management led to the nuclear disaster.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120723"/&gt;

The density is 160,000 times that of the legal limit for release into the ocean, and it is about 1,000 times that of the highest density in the groundwater that had been measured so far (5,100 Bq/L). TEPCO didn't disclose the result of measurement of strontium alone, as the company believed there was a possibility that the result of measurement was wrong. As to this particular sample, TEPCO had announced on July last year that the sample had contained 900,000 Bq/L of all-beta including strontium. On February 6, TEPCO explained that they had "underestimated all of the results of high-density all-beta, which exceeded the upper limit of measurement." This particular sample may contain about 10 million Bq/L of all-beta, according to TEPCO. The company recently switched to a different method of analysis that uses diluted samples when the density of radioactive materials is high.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2017 Ennore oil spill''' was an [[oil spill]] that occurred outside the [[Kamarajar Port]] in [[Ennore]] near [[Chennai]] in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/multimedia/Pollution-central-the-Ennore-oil-spill/article17124053.ece|title=Pollution central: the Ennore oil spill|last=Desk|first=Internet|work=The Hindu|access-date=27 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.uniindia.com/two-oil-ships-off-ennore-port-indian-coast-guard-on-alert/india/news/763312.html|title=Two oil ships collide off Ennore port, Indian Coast Guard on alert|date=28 January 2017|newspaper=United News of India (UNI)|access-date=7 February 2017|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spill occurred on 28 January 2017 when an outbound empty tanker ''BW Maple'' collided with an inbound loaded oil tanker ''Dawn Kanchipuram'' at 04:00 local time.

==Location==
The collision occurred two [[nautical mile]]s off Kamarajar Port in [[Ennore]], a natural harbour about 20&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Chennai]] on the [[Coromandel Coast]]. The [[Ennore creek]] (swampy backwater traversing over 13&amp;nbsp;km between [[Pulicat Lake]] in the north and [[Kosasthalaiyar River]] in the south and emptying into the [[Bay of Bengal]]) separates the town of Ennore from the Government held public company Kamarajar Port.

==Timeline==
The two ships collided at 4 am on 27 January 2017. In the morning, the Kamarajar port authority released a press statement that there is no damage to the environment and no casualty or injury to persons. It also indicated that both vessels are safely anchored and the extents of damage to the vessels are under assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ennoreport.gov.in/press_note_jan28_2017.pdf|title=Press Note - Kamarajar Port|date=28 January 2017|access-date=7 February 2017|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By afternoon, oil spill sheen was visible with dead turtles being washed ashore and residents of nearby coastal areas reporting a strong smell of oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/Chennai-oil-spill-dooms-turtles/article17113513.ece|title=Chennai oil spill dooms turtles|date=29 January 2017|newspaper=The Hindu|access-date=7 February 2017|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indian Coast Guard]] confirmed they were assessing the situation and providing assistance required. The Coast Guard also said that the spill would be contained in less than 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/jan/29/oil-spill-across-kamarajar-port-after-ships-collide-off-ennore-port-1564634.html|title=Oil spill across Kamarajar Port after ships collide off Ennore Port|last=Shivakumar|first=C|date=29 January 2017|newspaper=The New Indian Express (TNIE)|access-date=7 February 2017|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigation into the cause of the collision began on 29 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/%E2%80%98Misjudgment-caused-collision-of-ships%E2%80%99/article17113500.ece|title=Misjudgment caused collision of ships|last=Anand|first=N|date=29 January 2017|newspaper=The Hindu|access-date=7 February 2017|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 January 2017, the Kamarajar Port released a note claiming that there is no major damage to the environment or injury to persons and some sheens of oil traces were observed. It also stated that oil booms was deployed as a precautionary measure around the vessel Dawn Kanchipuram to contain seepage if any. The ship was subsequently brought into the port and berthed it after its cargo was discharged and vehicle inspections for damage assessment did not yield any evidence of an oil spill barring 'some sheens of oil traces', the press note said. The fishing community claimed that hundreds of fish had died and that they were unable to go for fishing because the spillage had come up to the shore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/Oil-pollution-threatens-Chennai%E2%80%99s-beaches-too/article17118935.ece|title=Oil pollution threatens Chennai’s beaches too|last=Ramakrishnan|first=Deepa H.|work=The Hindu|access-date=27 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newstodaynet.com/chennai/dead-turtles-fish-wash-ashore-after-collision|title=Dead turtles, fish wash ashore after collision|date=30 January 2017|newspaper=News Today|access-date=7 February 2017|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Containment and cleanup==
On 31 January 2017, the [[District collector]] of [[Tiruvallur district|Thiruvallur]] confirmed in a press meet that an oil spill took place after the incident on 28 January with [[Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board]] and the Fisheries Department being deployed to look into the situation. Manual efforts to remove the oil spill were made by the [[Indian Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], in addition to helicopter sorties to monitor the spread and assist in its removal. Three heavy buckets were used for removing the oil spill [[Chennai Corporation]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/oil-spill-in-chennai-sea-being-cleared-official/1/870819.html|title=Oil spill in Chennai sea being cleared: Official|date=31 January 2017|newspaper=India Today via PTI|access-date=7 February 2017|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 February, the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu [[O. Panneerselvam]] visited the site and declared that 90% of the clean up work was over with the remainder expected to be completed in a couple of days. He claimed tests had shown that the spill had not affected marine life, with fish safe for consumption, and also promised livelihood relief to the local fishing community.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2017/feb/05/90-percent-spill-cleared-fish-safe-for-consumption-cm-panneerselvam-on-chennai-oil-spill-1567244.html|title=90 percent spill cleared, fish safe for consumption: CM Panneerselvam on Chennai oil spill|date=5 February 2017|newspaper=The New Indian Express (TNIE)|access-date=7 February 2017|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 February, it was revealed that the viscous heavy oil being cleaned was [[Bunker fuel|heavy bunker fuel]] caused by a rupture in the fuel tanks of the oil tanker ''Dawn Kanchipuram'' and not from its cargo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/oil-spill-outbound-ship-didnt-heed-pilots-warning-of-collision/articleshow/57011581.cms|title=Oil spill: Outbound ship didn't heed pilot's warning of collision - Times of India|newspaper=The Times of India|access-date=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Union Carbide India Limited''' ('''UCIL''') was a [[Chemical industry|chemical company]] established in 1934, eventually expanding to employ 9,000 people working at 14 plants in five divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhopal.com/Chronology|title=History of UCIL|accessdate=2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=Bhopal: The World's Worst Industrial Disaster, 30 Years Later

Tamer Cavusgil, Gary Knight, John R. Riesenberger, Hussain G. Rammal, Elizabeth L. Rose |title=International Business |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KcSaBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA141 |year=2014 |publisher=Pearson Australia |isbn=978-1-4860-1138-4 |page=141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UCIL produced [[Electric battery|batteries]], carbon products, welding equipment, [[plastic]]s, industrial chemicals, [[pesticide]]s and marine products.

In 1970 UCIL built a pesticide plant in [[Bhopal]], India, which gained worldwide attention as a result of the [[Bhopal disaster]]. On 3 December 1984, a release of [[methyl isocyanate]] (MIC) gas immediately killed about three thousand people and led to the death of more than fifteen thousand in subsequent weeks and months. The death rate is currently about 2 or 3 people per week. At the time of the disaster, UCIL was ranked twenty-first in size among companies operating in India. It had revenues of Rs 2 billion (then equivalent to US$170 million). 

In November 1994, UCC completed the sale of its interest in UCIL to [[McLeod Russel]] of [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. UCIL was subsequently renamed [[Eveready Industries India]].

==Dangerous impacts of the Bhopal disaster==
{{unsourced-section|date=July 2018}}
In February 1989, the [[Supreme Court of India]] directed UCC and UCIL to pay $470 million to settle all claims arising from the tragedy. The government, UCC and UCIL agreed with the ruling, and the two companies paid the settlement on 24 February.

UCIL maintained a low profile in the post-Bhopal period. The chairman, Keshub Mahindra, and the Bhopal factory manager, J.Mukund, moved on to new positions. Most of the Bhopal plant managers left the company after the plant closed. UCIL closed the pesticide plant and reduced the Research and Development Center in Bhopal to a skeleton staff. 

Following the tragedy, the Government of India took control of the property. In 1994, Union Carbide sold its shares in UCIL to McLeod Russell. UCIL was subsequently renamed [[Eveready Industries]] India Ltd. (EIIL). As part of this transaction, EIIL became the property leaser and assumed responsibility for the site environmental cleanup.

On 14 January 1987, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] in [[Manhattan]] upheld a decision by the U.S. District Court to send the legal case against UCC to India. It ruled UCIL was a separate and independent legal entity managed and staffed by Indian citizens.

In June 2010, seven former employees of UCIL, all Indian nationals and many in their 70s, were convicted of causing death by negligence and each sentenced to two years' imprisonment and fined Rs.1 [[lakh]] (US$2,124). All were released on bail shortly after the verdict. The names of those convicted are: Keshub Mahindra, former non-executive chairman of Union Carbide India Limited; V.P. Gokhale, managing director; Kishore Kamdar, vice-president; J. Mukund, works manager; S.P. Chowdhury, production manager; K.V. Shetty, plant superintendent; and S.I. Qureshi, production assistant.

'''Suroopa Mukherjee''' is the author of several books for children and young people, including ''Bhopal Gas Tragedy: The Worst Industrial Disaster in Human History'', a book about the [[Bhopal disaster]]. She teaches English Literature at [[Hindu College, University of Delhi]] and is the coordinator of a student group dedicated to creating youth awareness on issues relating to environmental damage and corporate crime.

''Across The Mystic Shore'' was her [[debut novel]] for adults, released by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan New Writing]] in March 2007.
Her most recent book  "Surviving Bhopal" draws on oral testimonials of the affected community of the [[Bhopal disaster]] and analyzes the cause and aftermath of the disaster from the perspective of those who suffered the severe consequences of systemic failure and travesty of justice. The event resulted in a resistance movement, led by women, against corporate and state power. Mukherjee explores the underlying gender politics, showing how activism challenged and redefined the contemporary model of development.

==Bhopal disaster==

{{main|Bhopal disaster}}

The Bhopal disaster took place in a plant belonging to Union Carbide's (UCC) [[India]]n subsidiary, [[Union Carbide India Limited]], in the city of [[Bhopal]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], India during 1984. Thousands of people died and thousands more were injured in the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhopal.com/faq.htm Frequently Asked Questions regarding the Bhopal Tragedy of 1984] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408133152/http://www.bhopal.com/faq.htm |date=2010-04-08 }} Bhopal Information Center, Union Carbide Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; As the UCC CEO, Anderson was charged with [[manslaughter]] by Indian authorities. He flew to India and was promptly placed in custody by Indian authorities, but was allowed to return to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/saved-by-a-phone-call-the-mystery-of-warren-anderson-s-escape/article1-1281033.aspx | title=Saved by a phone call: the mystery of Warren Anderson's escape | publisher=[[Hindustan Times]] | work=Ranjan and Ashutosh | date=31 October 2014 | accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was declared a fugitive from justice by the Chief Judicial Magistrate of Bhopal on February 1, 1992, for failing to appear at the court hearings in a culpable homicide case.  A formal extradition request was issued in 2003.&lt;ref name="knowmore"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dow Chemical Company: Bhopal Disaster|url=http://knowmore.org/wiki/index.php?title=The_Dow_Chemical_Company#Bhopal_Disaster|publisher=Knowmore.org|accessdate=December 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/warren-anderson-30-year-old-road-to-nowhere/ | title=Warren Anderson: 30-Year old road to nowhere | publisher=Indian Express | date=1 November 2014 | accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States declined to extradite him citing a lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-06-10/india/28273885_1_extradition-treaty-warren-anderson-evidentiary-links Lack of Evidence Held up Anderson Extradition: MEA] Times of India, June 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The chief judicial magistrate of Bhopal issued an arrest warrant for Anderson on July 31, 2009.&lt;ref name="guardian uk"&gt;{{cite news|title=Court issues arrest warrant for former CEO of Union Carbide in gas leak case|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/31/warren-anderson-arrest-warrant|access-date=July 31, 2009|date=July 31, 2009|work=The Guardian |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, a UCC spokesperson said Union Carbide had no role in operating the plant at the time as the factory was owned, managed and operated by employees of Union Carbide India Limited.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/03/business/global/03bhopal.html?_r=1&amp;html Company Defends Chief in Bhopal Disaster] New York Times, August 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Eight former senior employees of the subsidiary were found guilty on June 7, 2010. After these convictions, a UCC spokesperson said, "All the appropriate people from UCIL – officers and those who actually ran the plant on a daily basis – have appeared to face charges."

'''''Five Past Midnight in Bhopal: The Epic Story of the World's Deadliest Industrial Disaster''''' is a book by [[Dominique Lapierre]] and [[Javier Moro]] based on the 1984 [[Bhopal disaster]].&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|title=Five past Midnight in Bhopal The Epic Story of the World's Deadliest Industrial Disaster|url=http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/dominique-lapierre/five-past-midnight-in-bhopal/9780446530880/|publisher=[[Hachette Book Group USA]]|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in 1997&lt;ref name=restrain&gt;{{cite news|title=Court restrains publishing of book|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/07/15/stories/2009071556320500.htm|accessdate=21 May 2014|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the English edition was published in 2001.&lt;ref name=outlookreview/&gt;

==Overview==
The authors researched the book by living in Bhopal for three years in the late 1990s. They interviewed people from India and United States, who were witnesses and participants. The book starts by following a group of rural immigrants who traveled to Bhopal to escape the drought in their own villages and settled in the slums. The books also chronicles the invention of American firm Union Carbide's chemical pesticide, [[Carbaryl|Sevin]], which used [[methyl isocyanate]] and [[1-Naphthol|α-naphthol]].&lt;ref name=bmj&gt;{{cite journal|title=Five past Midnight in Bhopal|journal=[[British Medical Journal]]|date=7 Sep 2002|author=Birte Twisselmann|pmc=1124076|page=552|volume=325|issue=7363|doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7363.552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book details the disaster which killed between 15000 and 30000. The narration follows characters like Padmini, a [[Oriya people|Oriya]] girl, who was to be married the night of the disaster in the slums, and Sister Felicity, a missionary from [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name=outlookreview&gt;{{cite news|title=City of survivors|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/book-review-it-was-five-past-midnight-in-bhopal-by-dominique-lapierre-and-javier-moro/1/231130.html|accessdate=21 May 2014|newspaper=[[Outlook India]]|date=10 September 2001|author=Mahesh Mathai}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bmj/&gt;&lt;ref name=onearth&gt;{{cite news|title=Reviews: Five past Midnight in Bhopal: The Epic Story of the World's Deadliest Industrial Disaster|url=http://www.nrdc.org/onearth/02fal/reviews.asp|accessdate=21 May 2014|newspaper=[[Natural Resources Defense Council#OnEarth Magazine|OnEarth Magazine]]|date=Fall 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also describes other characters like a tradesman who hired tents to offer some protection against the poison cloud and the railway station warden who tried to stop a train from halting there.&lt;ref name=bmj/&gt;

The final chapter follows the aftermath of the disaster. It tracks the people involved in the event, notably [[Warren Anderson (American businessman)|Warren Anderson]], the chairman of Union Carbide at the time, and Warren Woomer, the supervisor of the factory in Bhopal.&lt;ref name=bmj/&gt;

==Film rights==
In September 2001, it was reported that director [[Oliver Stone]] was in negotiation with Dominique Lapierre for film rights to the book.&lt;ref name=movie1&gt;{{cite news|title=Oliver Stone tackles Indian gas leak disaster|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/sep/07/news1|accessdate=21 May 2014|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=7 Sep 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defamation lawsuit in India==
In July 2009, a [[Jabalpur]] court restrained the publication and sales of book in India, in an order directed at the authors and the local publishers of the book, Full Circle Publication. The order came after a former [[Director General of Police]] of [[Madhya Pradesh]], Swaraj Puri, filed a [[defamation]] lawsuit for allegedly carrying defamatory remarks attributed to him.&lt;ref name=restrain/&gt; Puri was the [[Police Commissioner]] of Bhopal on the night of the disaster. In a joint statement, authors said the portions objected to by Puri had been substantiated by Moti Singh, who then the [[District collector|Collector]] of Bhopal and to whom Puri reported during the event, in his own 2008 book called ''Unfolding The Betrayal Of Bhopal Gas Tragedy''.&lt;ref name=courtstops&gt;{{cite news|title=Court stops sale of book on Bhopal gas tragedy|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-court-stops-sale-of-book-on-bhopal-gas-tragedy-1280773|accessdate=21 May 2014|newspaper=[[DNA India]]|date=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puri's lawyer, Rajesh Pancholi, stated that a legal noticed had been sent to the authors in 2002. But added that the legal proceedings were delayed because the authors lived abroad. He said that initially a demand of {{currency|10|USD}} million had been sent to the authors via email as compensation for the damage to Puri's reputation. Later, the sum was doubled because there was no response. He also said that Puri was more interested in a public apology than any monetary compensation.&lt;ref name=courtstops/&gt;

Pradeep Bakshi, the lawyer for [[Delhi]]-based Full Circle Publication, said that it was primarily a monetary issue. A spokesman from publishers denied that the book got any sales boost from the lawsuit, but alleged that the lawsuit was aimed to harass as it was filed in Jabalpur and their lawyer had to travel there. Another spokesman noted that Moti Singh's book was more damaging to Puri's reputation, yet no case was filed against him.&lt;ref name=courtstops/&gt;

On 8 October 2009, [[Madhya Pradesh High Court]] lifted the restrain order from the lower courts, after hearing a petition from the authors and publisher which stated that there was no derogatory content about Puri in the book.&lt;ref name=HC&gt;{{cite news|title=MP HC stays ban on book ''Five past Midnight in Bhopal''|url=http://www.indlawnews.com/newsdisplay.aspx?346c3ed4-4fed-467a-8c98-cc961bf49989|accessdate=21 May 2014|newspaper=IndLaw News|date=8 Oct 2009|agency=[[United News of India]] (UNI)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130811144507/http://www.indlawnews.com/newsdisplay.aspx?346c3ed4-4fed-467a-8c98-cc961bf49989|archivedate=11 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sunil Verma''' (1972 −  16 August 2006), himself a victim, was a campaigner for the rights of victims affected by the [[Bhopal disaster]], the deadliest [[industrial disaster]] as of 2007. He testified in a case against the company when it came up for hearing in [[New York City]] in 1986. He formed the [[Children Against Carbide]] organization in 1987, when he was fifteen. 

== The gas disaster ==
Born in [[Bhopal]] in 1972, the son of a carpenter, Verma lived in [[JP Nagar]], near the plant run by [[Union Carbide]], now a subsidiary of [[Dow Chemical]]s, when the gas leak occurred on 3 December 1984. He and his family tried to escape, as the poisonous cloud of [[methyl isocyanate]] gas descended on the slum settlement in [[Madhya Pradesh]]'s state capital. The family members got separated, and Sunil Verma, with eyes burning and chest in pain, managed to board a bus that took him to [[Hoshangabad]], about 70km (44 miles) away. He lost consciousness and was taken to the district hospital. 

He returned to [[Bhopal]] a week later to find both his parents, three sisters and two brothers dead. His two younger siblings, a sister aged 10 and a brother of two-and-half, were the only other survivors. Relatives took the children to [[Lucknow]], but the children returned to Bhopal, surviving on the generosity of neighbours, both [[Hindu]] and [[Muslim]]. Sunil's sister and brother moved to the SOS village - a shelter set up by a charity to house orphans of the gas tragedy - while Sunil managed to study into his teenage years.

== Activism ==
He was chosen to lay the foundation stone for the first People's [[Clinic]] in Bhopal for the gas victims in June 1985. [[Children Against Carbide]] mobilized orphans and other victims to demand justice for survivors of the disaster. The issues involved were those of compensation and health. 

Verma was also a member of the [[Bhopal Group for Information and Action]], and participated in every anniversary rally to mark the disaster, as his health deteriorated.

In February 1989, the Indian government settled out of court with Union Carbide, the latter making a US$470 million payout as part of the deal. Verma traveled to [[Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]] and the [[United Kingdom]] to mobilize support against the settlement. He was arrested in [[Houston, Texas]], when he attempted to table an environmental report at the Union Carbide annual meeting. A public outcry resulted in his quick release. Verma had received US$2,200 from the claims tribunal disbursing the settlement, though he was entitled to nearly four times that sum. He attempted to start a business with the money, but the attempt ended in failure. He was granted a house as part of a government relief scheme, but generous to a fault, he gave it to a homeless friend. 

He worked as a volunteer at the [[Sambhavna Trust Clinic]] for survivors and even though he was unemployed at that time, he refused to take money for his work. He also toured [[India]], speaking out for those in need. Along with others orphaned by the gas, Sunil sat on hunger strike in [[Bhopal]] for six days in 2003, demanding the jobs that the government had offered years before.

== Illness ==
In March 1997 Sunil started "hearing voices in his head". He also suffered from [[insomnia]] and imagined people were plotting to kill him. By June 1997 his condition worsened and he often ran away from home. He had attempted suicide several times. He was finally diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]] - a mental illness which affected many gas survivors {{Fact|date=March 2008}} - and began treatment.

He hanged himself in 2006, leaving a note behind that he was committing suicide not because he was mentally unsound but with all his wits about him. After Sunil's death, many people from the Netherlands, the U.S., South Africa and other countries raised funds in his memory to establish a mental health centre.

'''Michael "Mike" V. Ciresi''' is a prominent [[Attorney at law (United States)|trial attorney]] and was a [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party|Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party]] candidate for the [[United States Senate]] from [[Minnesota]].  He dropped out on March 10, 2008. Ciresi gained his public reputation by litigating several high-profile [[mass tort]] cases.  Ciresi is the former Chairman of the Executive Board of the Minneapolis firm [[Robins, Kaplan, Miller &amp; Ciresi]] LLP, a 250-lawyer firm he joined in 1971.

==Role in Minnesota lawsuit against Big Tobacco==
He was counsel to the State of Minnesota and [[Blue Cross and Blue Shield]] of Minnesota against the [[United States|American]] [[tobacco industry]], suing in 1994 as the second of eventually 46 states to join in the [[tobacco litigation]]. Ciresi's [[Minneapolis]] law firm, [[Robins, Kaplan, Miller &amp; Ciresi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rkmc.com|title=Robins Kaplan LLP|website=Robins Kaplan LLP Law Firm}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which he was the chair, settled with the tobacco companies in 1998 with an agreement for the tobacco defendants to pay the state of Minnesota $6 billion. The law firm donated $30 million to the Minneapolis Foundation in 1998, a contribution made possible by the settlement fee; at the time, the gift was thought to be the largest contribution from a law firm to a community foundation. Ciresis has been on the Board of Trustees of his alma mater, the University of St. Thomas, and on the Board of Governors of the University of St. Thomas School of Law. He has served on the board of Regions Hospital Foundation and Minnesota Early Learning Foundation.

Ciresi's law firm was mentioned in the press for the legal fees collected in the 1998 tobacco settlement, variously reported as between $440 million and $558 million[https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2001/0514/134.html].  The fees were to be paid over two years[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1036630492127], in contrast to the 25-year annual payment scheme used to pay the plaintiffs of the case, the State of Minnesota.  The fees were funded directly by tobacco companies.  

As a result of the 1998 Minnesota tobacco settlement, Ciresi came to be known as a wealthy man and philanthropist, appearing regularly in the national and local press.{{cn|date=February 2019}}  According to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, with Ciresi among the highest-paid lawyers in the USA, "Cigarette money alone put these ten lawyers on the top-earning list—and it's likely to keep them there for the next 25 years."  The magazine listed Ciresi's personal annual income at $14.4 million in 2000.  ''Forbes'' speculated that Ciresi would use his newfound wealth and prominence to run for political office,[https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2001/0514/134.html] which soon proved correct.

==Other famous cases==
Ciresi served as counsel to the Government of [[India]] against [[Union Carbide]] over the [[Bhopal disaster|Bhopal catastrophe]]. He was counsel to women rendered infertile by the [[Copper 7]] [[IUD]] and to the families of women killed by the [[Dalkon Shield]] IUD.  

==U.S. Senate run==
Ciresi ran in the [[U.S. Senate election, 2000|2000]] Senate primary for the [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party|Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party]] (DFL), spending several million dollars of his own money on the campaign. Ciresi ran as a self-described progressive moderate, and was endorsed by the [[Sierra Club]] and the Minnesota Nurses' Association. Ciresi was handily defeated by [[Mark Dayton]], an heir to the founders of [[Target Corporation]], in the four-way DFL primary. Dayton then came from behind in the polls to defeat first-term incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Rod Grams]] in the general election.

Dayton announced in early 2005 that he would not seek a second term.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Khoo, [http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/02/09_khoom_dayton/ "Dayton won't seek re-election as Minnesota U.S. senator"], ''[[Minnesota Public Radio]]'', February 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Ciresi indicated an interest in the race and registered the domain name ciresiforsenate.com within 48 hours of Dayton's announcement, he announced on February 7 that he would not seek the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060215224311/http://www.startribune.com/587/story/232572.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
He would have faced [[Hennepin County, Minnesota|Hennepin County]] district attorney [[Amy Klobuchar]] and [[Ford Bell]] in the DFL primary.

On April 18, 2007, Ciresi announced that he would seek the DFL endorsement] for the Senate seat held by [[Norm Coleman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/04/18/ciresi/]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Democrats in the race included author and satirist [[Al Franken]], [[professor]] and [[author]] [[Jack Nelson-Pallmeyer]], and [[Human Rights|Human Rights Activist]] [[Jim Cohen]]. On March 10, 2008, Ciresi announced his withdrawal from the primary&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/senate/16463506.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2008, the Minnesota DFL endorsed Franken.  Ciresi was widely reported on June 11 as saying he was "leaving all options on the table" when questioned about a possible primary run against Franken.&lt;ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20080612144429/http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/senate/19630619.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  But Ciresi eventually dropped out of the race without challenging Franken in the primary.

The '''Bhopal disaster''', also referred to as the '''Bhopal gas tragedy''', was a [[gas leak]] incident on the night of 2–3 December 1984 at the [[Union Carbide India Limited]] (UCIL) [[pesticide]] plant in [[Bhopal]], Madhya Pradesh, India. It is considered to be [[List of accidents and disasters by death toll#Industrial disasters|the world's worst]] [[List of industrial disasters|industrial disaster]].&lt;ref name="MandavilliUnfolding" /&gt;&lt;ref name="convictions"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8725140.stm|title=Bhopal trial: Eight convicted over India gas disaster |date=7 June 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=7 June 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607185745/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8725140.stm| archivedate= 7 June 2010 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 500,000 people were exposed to [[methyl isocyanate|methyl isocyanate (MIC)]] gas. The highly toxic substance made its way into and around the small towns located near the plant.&lt;ref name="Varma 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Varma|first=Roli|author2=Daya R.

Estimates vary on the death toll. The official immediate death toll was 2,259. The [[government of Madhya Pradesh]] confirmed a total of 3,787 deaths related to the gas release.&lt;ref name="rehabilitation1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mp.gov.in/bgtrrdmp/relief.htm |title=Madhya Pradesh Government : Bhopal Gas Tragedy Relief and Rehabilitation Department, Bhopal |publisher=Mp.gov.in |accessdate=28 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518020821/http://www.mp.gov.in/bgtrrdmp/relief.htm |archivedate=18 May 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A government affidavit in 2006 stated that the leak caused 558,125 injuries, including 38,478 temporary partial injuries and approximately 3,900 severely and permanently disabling injuries.&lt;ref name="first3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.first14.com/bhopal-gas-tragedy-92-injuries-termed-minor-822.html |title=Bhopal Gas Tragedy: 92% injuries termed "minor" |accessdate=26 June 2010 |newspaper=First14 News |date=21 June 2010 |author=AK Dubey |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qmWBEWcb?url=http://www.first14.com/bhopal-gas-tragedy-92-injuries-termed-minor-822.html |archivedate=26 June 2010 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others estimate that 8,000 died within two weeks, and another 8,000 or more have since died from gas-related diseases.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005"/&gt;  The cause of the disaster remains under debate. The Indian government and local activists argue that slack management and deferred maintenance created a situation where routine pipe maintenance caused a backflow of water into a MIC tank, triggering the disaster. [[Union Carbide Corporation]] (UCC) argues water entered the tank through an act of sabotage.

The owner of the factory, UCIL, was majority owned by UCC, with Indian Government-controlled banks and the Indian public holding a 49.1 percent stake. In 1989, UCC paid $470 million ($929 million in 2017 dollars) to settle litigation stemming from the disaster. In 1994, UCC sold its stake in UCIL to [[Eveready Industries India|Eveready Industries India Limited]] (EIIL), which subsequently merged with [[McLeod Russel|McLeod Russel (India) Ltd]]. Eveready ended clean-up on the site in 1998, when it terminated its 99-year lease and turned over control of the site to the state government of Madhya Pradesh. [[Dow Chemical Company]] purchased UCC in 2001, seventeen years after the disaster.

Civil and criminal cases filed in the United States against UCC and [[Warren Anderson (American businessman)|Warren Anderson]], UCC CEO at the time of the disaster, were dismissed and redirected to Indian courts on multiple occasions between 1986 and 2012, as the US courts focused on UCIL being a standalone entity of India. Civil and criminal cases were also filed in the [[District Courts of India|District Court]] of Bhopal, India, involving UCC, UCIL and UCC CEO Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=New York Times|title=Company Defends Chief in Bhopal Disaster |url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/03/company-defends-chief-in-bhopal-disaster/ | date=3 August 2009 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[CBS News]] |title=U.S. Exec Arrest Sought in Bhopal Disaster |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/07/31/world/main5201155.shtml | date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, seven Indian nationals who were UCIL employees in 1984, including the former UCIL chairman, were convicted in Bhopal of causing death by negligence and sentenced to two years imprisonment and a fine of about $2,000 each, the maximum punishment allowed by [[Law of India|Indian law]]. All were released on bail shortly after the verdict. An eighth former employee was also convicted, but died before the judgement was passed.&lt;ref name="convictions" /&gt;

==The pre-event phase==
The UCIL factory was built in 1969 to produce the pesticide Sevin (UCC's brand name for [[carbaryl]]) using [[methyl isocyanate|methyl isocyanate (MIC)]] as an intermediate.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eckerman |first=Ingrid |title=The Bhopal Saga—Causes and Consequences of the World's Largest Industrial Disaster |url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0FqO8XKy9NRZDNzTkZQeVJQbE0/edit?pli=1 |year=2005 |publisher=Universities Press |location=India |isbn=978-81-7371-515-0 |doi=10.13140/2.1.3457.5364}}&lt;/ref&gt; An MIC production plant was added to the UCIL site in 1979.&lt;ref name="UCCmanual1976"&gt;{{cite book |title=Methyl isocyanate |year=1976 |publisher=Union Carbide Corporation |location=New York}} F-41443A-7/76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UCCmanual1978"&gt;{{cite book |title=Carbon monoxide, Phosgene and Methyl isocyanate.

Methyl Isocyanate Unit |authors=Behl VK, Agarwal VN, Choudhary SP, Khanna S |location=Bhopal |publisher=Union Carbide India Limited, Agricultural Products Division |year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chemical process employed in the Bhopal plant had [[methylamine]] reacting with [[phosgene]] to form MIC, which was then reacted with [[1-naphthol]] to form the final product, carbaryl. Another manufacturer, Bayer, also used this MIC-intermediate process at the chemical plant once owned by UCC at [[Institute, West Virginia]], in the United States.&lt;ref name="Kovel"&gt;Kovel (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvgazette.com/News/201103181523|title=Bayer gives up fight to restart Institute MIC unit|author=Ward, Ken Jr.|date=18 March 2011|work=The Charleston Gazette|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Bhopal plant was built, other manufacturers (including [[Bayer]]) produced carbaryl without MIC, though at a greater [[manufacturing cost]]. This "route" differed from the MIC-free routes used elsewhere, in which the same raw materials were combined in a different manufacturing order, with phosgene first reacting with naphthol to form a chloroformate ester, which was then reacted with methylamine. In the early 1980s, the demand for pesticides had fallen, but production continued, leading to build-up of stores of unused MIC where that method was used.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kovel" /&gt;

===Earlier leaks===
In 1976, two local trade unions complained of pollution within the plant.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2006"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ttl.fi/en/publications/electronic_journals/asian_pacific_newsletter/archives/Documents/asian_pacific_newsletter2_2006.pdf |title=The Bhopal Disaster 1984&amp;nbsp;– working conditions and the role of the trade unions |last=Eckerman |first=Ingrid |journal=Asian Pacific Newsletter on Occupational Health and Safety |year=2006 |volume=13 |issue=2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716021643/http://www.ttl.fi/en/publications/electronic_journals/asian_pacific_newsletter/archives/Documents/asian_pacific_newsletter2_2006.pdf |archivedate=16 July 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, a worker was accidentally splashed with [[phosgene]] as he was carrying out a maintenance job of the plant's pipes. In a panic, he removed his [[gas mask]] and inhaled a large amount of toxic phosgene gas, leading to his death just 72 hours later.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2006" /&gt; Following these events, journalist [[Rajkumar Keswani]] began investigating and published his findings in Bhopal's local paper ''Rapat,'' in which he urged "Wake up people of Bhopal, you are on the edge of a volcano".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/11/world/indian-journalist-offered-warning.html|title=INDIAN JOURNALIST OFFERED WARNING|last=Hazarika|first=Sanjoy|access-date=2 October 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to be really well informed in minutes|last=The Week|publisher=Ebury Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-09194-706-4|location=Croydon|pages=222–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1982, a phosgene leak exposed 24 workers, all of whom were admitted to a hospital. None of the workers had been ordered to wear protective masks. One month later, in February 1982, an MIC leak affected 18 workers. In August 1982, a chemical engineer came into contact with liquid MIC, resulting in burns over 30 percent of his body. Later that same year, in October 1982, there was another MIC leak. In attempting to stop the leak, the MIC supervisor suffered severe chemical burns and two other workers were severely exposed to the gases. During 1983 and 1984, there were leaks of MIC, chlorine, monomethylamine, phosgene, and [[carbon tetrachloride]], sometimes in combination.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2006" /&gt;

==The leakage and its subsequent effects==

=== Liquid MIC storage ===
The Bhopal UCIL facility housed three underground 68,000 liters liquid MIC storage tanks: E610, E611, and E619. In the months leading up to the December leak, liquid MIC production was in progress and being used to fill these tanks. UCC safety regulations specified that no one tank should be filled more than 50% (here, 30 tons) with liquid MIC. Each tank was pressurized with inert nitrogen gas. This pressurization allowed liquid MIC to be pumped out of each tank as needed, and also kept impurities out of the tanks.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.engr.utexas.edu/ethics/profresp/lesson2/engineers.cfm|title=UT Austin College of Engineering -- Ethics Modules :: Go Public|website=apps.engr.utexas.edu|access-date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 1984, tank E610 lost the ability to effectively contain most of its nitrogen gas pressure. It meant that the liquid MIC contained within could not be pumped out. At the time of this failure, tank E610 contained 42 tons of liquid MIC.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=72JUj80ZTIwC|title=Wealth from Waste|last=Agarwal|first=S. K.|date=1 January 2005|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=9788176488235|page=131|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after this failure, MIC production was halted at the Bhopal facility, and parts of the plant were shut down for maintenance. Maintenance included the shutdown of the plant's flare tower so that a corroded pipe could be repaired.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; With the flare tower still out of service, production of carbaryl was resumed in late November, using MIC stored in the two tanks still in service. An attempt to re-establish pressure in tank E610 on 1 December failed, so the 42 tons of liquid MIC contained within still could not be pumped out of it.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

===The release===
[[File:Bhopal Plant 7.JPG|thumb|Tank 610 in 2010. During decontamination of the plant, tank 610 was removed from its foundation and left aside.]]

In early December 1984, most of the plant's MIC related safety systems were malfunctioning and many valves and lines were in poor condition. In addition, several vent gas scrubbers had been out of service as well as the steam boiler, intended to clean the pipes.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;  During the late evening hours of 2 December 1984, water was believed to have entered a side pipe and into Tank E610 whilst trying to unclog it, which contained 42 tons of MIC that had been there since late October.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;
The introduction of water into the tank subsequently resulted in a [[Thermal runaway|runaway]] [[exothermic reaction]], which was accelerated by contaminants, high ambient temperatures and various other factors, such as the presence of iron from corroding non-stainless steel pipelines.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; The pressure in tank E610, although initially normal at 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., had increased by a factor of five to 10 psi (34.5 to 69&amp;nbsp;kPa) by 11 p.m. Two different senior refinery employees assumed the reading was instrumentation malfunction.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/30/world/the-disaster-in-bhopal-workers-recall-horror.html|title=THE DISASTER IN BHOPAL: WORKERS RECALL HORROR|last=Times|first=Stuart Diamond, Special To The New York|date=30 January 1985|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., workers in the MIC area were feeling the effects of minor exposure to MIC gas, and began to look for a leak. One was found by 11:45&amp;nbsp;p.m., and reported to the MIC supervisor on duty at the time. The decision was made to address the problem after a 12:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. tea break, and in the meantime, employees were instructed to continue looking for leaks. The incident was discussed by MIC area employees during the break.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the five minutes after the tea break ended at 12:40&amp;nbsp;a.m., the reaction in tank E610 reached a critical state at an alarming speed. Temperatures in the tank were off the scale, maxed out beyond  {{convert|25|°C|°F}}, and the pressure in the tank was indicated at 40 psi (275.8&amp;nbsp;kPa). One employee witnessed a concrete slab above tank E610 crack as the emergency relief valve burst open, and pressure in the tank continued to increase to 55 psi (379.2&amp;nbsp;kPa) even after atmospheric venting of toxic MIC gas had begun.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Direct atmospheric venting should have been prevented or at least partially mitigated by at least three safety devices which were malfunctioning, not in use, insufficiently sized or otherwise rendered inoperable:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Patrick McClelland|title=BBC One Night In Bhopal 2004 TVRip d0x|date=31 December 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJg19W8x_Ls|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bhopal.net/what-happened/that-night-december-3-1984/what-triggered-the-disaster/|title=What Triggered the Disaster? {{!}} International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal|website=bhopal.net|access-date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A refrigeration system meant to cool tanks containing liquid MIC, shut down in January 1982, and whose freon had been removed in June 1984. Since the MIC storage system assumed refrigeration, its high temperature alarm, set to sound at {{convert|11|°C|°F}} had long since been disconnected, and tank storage temperatures ranged between {{convert|15|°C|°F}} and {{convert|40|°C|°F}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-15-22804|title=Remembering Bhopal: NES Workshop 2015|last=Jones|first=Tommy Ray|date=16 April 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A flare tower, to burn the MIC gas as it escaped, which had had a connecting pipe removed for maintenance, and was improperly sized to neutralise a leak of the size produced by tank E610
* A vent gas scrubber, which had been deactivated at the time and was in 'standby' mode, and similarly had insufficient [[Sodium hydroxide|caustic soda]] and power to safely stop a leak of the magnitude produced

About 30 tonnes of MIC escaped from the tank into the atmosphere in 45 to 60 minutes.&lt;ref name="Varma 2005" /&gt; This would increase to 40 tonnes within two hours time.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thephoenixsun.com/archives/7118|title=The Phoenix Sun {{!}} Disaster Politics {{!}} Bhopal to Copenhagen|website=thephoenixsun.com|access-date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gases were blown in a southeasterly direction over Bhopal.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Bhopal Nightmare|episodelink=|series=Seconds from Disaster|serieslink=Seconds from Disaster|credits=Narrator: Ashton Smith|network=Nat Geo|date=10 October 2011|season=4|number=6|minutes=5:45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A UCIL employee triggered the plant's alarm system at 12:50&amp;nbsp;a.m. as the concentration of gas in and around the plant became difficult to tolerate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Activation of the system triggered two siren alarms: one that sounded inside the UCIL plant, and a second directed outward to the public and the city of Bhopal. The two siren systems had been decoupled from one another in 1982, so that it was possible to leave the factory warning siren on while turning off the public one, and this is exactly what was done: the public siren briefly sounded at 12:50&amp;nbsp;a.m. and was quickly turned off, as per company procedure meant to avoid alarming the public around the factory over tiny leaks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cseindia.org/userfiles/THE%20BHOPAL%20DISASTER.pdf|title=The Bhopal Disaster (India's Environment 1984-85)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528042900/http://www.cseindia.org/userfiles/THE%20BHOPAL%20DISASTER.pdf|archivedate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Citation|last=Patrick McClelland|title=BBC One Night In Bhopal 2004 TVRip d0x|date=31 December 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJg19W8x_Ls|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers, meanwhile, evacuated the UCIL plant, travelling upwind.

Bhopal's superintendent of police was informed by telephone, by a town inspector, that residents of the neighbourhood of Chola (about 2&amp;nbsp;km from the plant) were fleeing a gas leak at approximately 1 a.m.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Calls to the UCIL plant by police between 1:25 and 2:10&amp;nbsp;a.m. gave assurances twice that "everything is OK", and on the last attempt made, "we don't know what has happened, sir".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With the lack of timely information exchange between UCIL and Bhopal authorities, the city's [[Hamidia Hospital]] was first told that the gas leak was suspected to be [[ammonia]], then [[phosgene]]. Finally, they received an updated report that it was "MIC" (rather than "methyl isocyanate"), which hospital staff had never heard of, had no antidote for, and received no immediate information about.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Disaster One|title=Seconds From Disaster - Bhopal Nightmare|date=18 October 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOIFK0E1Pgs|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MIC gas leak emanating from tank E610 petered out at approximately 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. Fifteen minutes later, the plant's public siren was sounded for an extended period of time, after first having been quickly silenced an hour and a half earlier.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kTESCgAAQBAJ|title=An Invitation to Environmental Sociology|last=Bell|first=Michael Mayerfeld|last2=Ashwood|first2=Loka L.|date=1 July 2015|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781452275789|page=164|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some minutes after the public siren sounded, a UCIL employee walked to a police control room to both inform them of the leak (their first acknowledgement that one had occurred at all), and that "the leak had been plugged."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Most city residents who were exposed to the MIC gas were first made aware of the leak by exposure to the gas itself, or by opening their doors to investigate commotion, rather than having been instructed to [[shelter in place]], or to evacuate before the arrival of the gas in the first place.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Acute effects===
[[File:Glutathione + Methylisocyanate Reaction.svg|thumb|Reversible reaction of [[glutathione]] (top) with [[methyl isocyanate]] (MIC, middle) allows the MIC to be transported into the body]]

The initial effects of exposure were coughing, severe eye irritation and a feeling of suffocation, burning in the respiratory tract, [[blepharospasm]], breathlessness, stomach pains and vomiting. People awakened by these symptoms fled away from the plant. Those who ran inhaled more than those who had a vehicle to ride. Owing to their height, children and other people of shorter stature inhaled higher concentrations, as methyl isocyanate gas is approximately twice as dense as air and hence in an open environment has a tendency to fall toward the ground.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt;

Thousands of people had died by the following morning. Primary causes of deaths were [[choking]], reflexogenic [[circulatory collapse]] and [[pulmonary oedema]]. Findings during [[autopsy|autopsies]] revealed changes not only in the lungs but also [[cerebral oedema]], [[tubular necrosis]] of the kidneys, [[Fatty liver|fatty degeneration of the liver]] and necrotising [[enteritis]].&lt;ref name="Sriramachari"&gt;Sriramachari (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[stillbirth]] rate increased by up to 300% and [[Perinatal mortality#Neonatal mortality|neonatal mortality]] rate by around 200%.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;

=== Gas cloud composition ===
Apart from MIC, based on laboratory simulation conditions, the gas cloud most likely also contained [[chloroform]], [[dichloromethane]], [[hydrogen chloride]], [[methyl amine]], [[dimethylamine]], [[trimethylamine]] and [[carbon dioxide]], that was either present in the tank or was produced in the storage tank when MIC, chloroform and water reacted. The gas cloud, composed mainly of materials denser than air, stayed close to the ground and spread in the southeasterly direction affecting the nearby communities.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; The chemical reactions may have produced a liquid or solid [[aerosol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=30 September 2012|title=Bhopal atmospheric dispersion revisited|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|volume=233–234|pages=33–40|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.06.055|pmid=22819479|vauthors=Havens J, Walker H, Spicer T}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Laboratory investigations by CSIR and UCC scientists failed to demonstrate the presence of hydrogen cyanide.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt;&lt;ref name="csir"&gt;{{cite book|title=Report on Scientific Studies on the Factors Related to Bhopal Toxic Gas Leakage|publisher=New Delhi: Indian Council of Scientific and Industrial Research|year=1985|display-authors=etal|author=Varadarajan S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Immediate aftermath====
In the immediate aftermath, the plant was closed to outsiders (including UCC) by the [[Government of India|Indian government]], which subsequently failed to make data public, contributing to the confusion. The initial investigation was conducted entirely by the [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR) and the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]]. The UCC chairman and CEO [[Warren Anderson (American businessman)|Warren Anderson]], together with a technical team, immediately traveled to India. Upon arrival Anderson was placed under house arrest and urged by the Indian government to leave the country within 24 hours. Union Carbide organized a team of international medical experts, as well as supplies and equipment, to work with the local Bhopal medical community, and the UCC technical team began assessing the cause of the gas leak.

The health care system immediately became overloaded. In the severely affected areas, nearly 70 percent were under-qualified doctors. Medical staff were unprepared for the thousands of casualties. Doctors and hospitals were not aware of proper treatment methods for MIC gas inhalation.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

There were mass funerals and cremations. Photographer [[Pablo Bartholomew|Pablo Bartholemew]], on commission with press agency [[Rapho (agency)|Rapho]], took an iconic color photograph of a burial on 4 December, ''Bhopal gas disaster girl.'' Another photographer present, [[Raghu Rai]], took a black and white photo. The photographers did not ask for the identity of the father or child as she was buried, and no relative has since confirmed it. As such, the identity of the girl remains unknown. Both photos became symbolic of the suffering of victims of the Bhopal disaster, and Bartholomew's went on to win the 1984 World Press Photo of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/1985/world-press-photo-year/pablo-bartholomew|title=1985 Pablo Bartholomew WY|website=World Press Photo|access-date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few days, trees in the vicinity became barren and bloated animal carcasses had to be disposed of. 170,000 people were treated at hospitals and temporary dispensaries, and 2,000 buffalo, goats, and other animals were collected and buried. Supplies, including food, became scarce owing to suppliers' safety fears. Fishing was prohibited causing further supply shortages.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;

Lacking any safe alternative, on 16 December, tanks 611 and 619 were emptied of the remaining MIC by reactivating the plant and continuing the manufacture of pesticide. Despite safety precautions such as having water carrying helicopters continually overflying the plant, this led to a second mass evacuation from Bhopal. The Government of India passed the "Bhopal Gas Leak Disaster Act" that gave the government rights to represent all victims, whether or not in India. Complaints of lack of information or misinformation were widespread. An Indian government spokesman said, "Carbide is more interested in getting information from us than in helping our relief work".&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;

Formal statements were issued that air, water, vegetation and foodstuffs were safe, but warned not to consume fish. The number of children exposed to the gases was at least 200,000.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; Within weeks, the State Government established a number of hospitals, clinics and mobile units in the gas-affected area to treat the victims.

===Subsequent legal action===

Legal proceedings involving UCC, the United States and Indian governments, local Bhopal authorities, and the disaster victims started immediately after the catastrophe. The Indian Government passed the Bhopal Gas Leak Act in March 1985, allowing the Government of India to act as the legal representative for victims of the disaster,&lt;ref name="chrono" /&gt; leading to the beginning of legal proceedings. Initial lawsuits were generated in the United States federal court system. On 17 April 1985, Federal District court judge [[John F. Keenan]] (overseeing one lawsuit) suggested that "'fundamental human decency' required Union Carbide to provide between $5 million and $10 million to immediately help the injured" and suggested the money could be quickly distributed through the International Red Cross.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/120143461|title=19 Apr 1985, Page 56 - Arizona Republic at Newspapers.com|website=$5 million in relief offered to gas-leak victims|access-date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; UCC, on the notion that doing so did not constitute an admission of liability and the figure could be credited toward any future settlement or judgement, offered a $5 million relief fund two days later.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The Indian government turned down the offer.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt;

In March 1986 UCC proposed a settlement figure, endorsed by plaintiffs' U.S. attorneys, of {{Nowrap|$350 million}} that would, according to the company, "generate a fund for Bhopal victims of between {{Nowrap|$500–600 million}} over 20 years". In May, litigation was transferred from the United States to Indian courts by a U.S. District Court ruling. Following an appeal of this decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the transfer, judging, in January 1987, that UCIL was a "separate entity, owned, managed and operated exclusively by Indian citizens in India".&lt;ref name="chrono" /&gt;

The Government of India refused the offer from Union Carbide and claimed US${{Nowrap|3.3 billion}}.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; The [[Supreme Court of India|Indian Supreme Court]] told both sides to come to an agreement and "start with a clean slate" in November 1988.&lt;ref name="chrono" /&gt; Eventually, in an out-of-court settlement reached in February 1989, Union Carbide agreed to pay US${{Nowrap|470 million}} for damages caused in the Bhopal disaster.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; The amount was immediately paid.

Throughout 1990, the [[Indian Supreme Court]] heard appeals against the settlement. In October 1991, the Supreme Court upheld the original {{Nowrap|$470 million}}, dismissing any other outstanding petitions that challenged the original decision. The Court ordered the Indian government "to purchase, out of settlement fund, a group medical insurance policy to cover 100,000 persons who may later develop symptoms" and cover any shortfall in the settlement fund. It also requested UCC and its subsidiary UCIL "voluntarily" fund a hospital in Bhopal, at an estimated {{Nowrap|$17 million}}, to specifically treat victims of the Bhopal disaster. The company agreed to this.&lt;ref name="chrono" /&gt;

===Post-settlement activity===

In 1991, the local Bhopal authorities charged Anderson, who had retired in 1986, with manslaughter, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. He was declared a fugitive from justice by the Chief Judicial Magistrate of Bhopal on 1 February 1992 for failing to appear at the court hearings in a culpable [[homicide]] case in which he was named the chief defendant. Orders were passed to the Government of India to press for an [[extradition]] from the United States. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] refused to hear an appeal of the decision of the lower federal courts in October 1993, meaning that victims of the Bhopal disaster could not seek damages in a U.S. court.&lt;ref name="chrono" /&gt;

In 2004, the Indian Supreme Court ordered the Indian government to release any remaining settlement funds to victims. And in September 2006, the Welfare Commission for Bhopal Gas Victims announced that all original compensation claims and revised petitions had been "cleared".&lt;ref name="chrono" /&gt; The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] in New York City upheld the dismissal of remaining claims in the case of ''Bano v. Union Carbide Corporation'' in 2006. This move blocked plaintiffs' motions for class certification and claims for property damages and remediation. In the view of UCC, "the ruling reaffirms UCC's long-held positions and finally puts to rest—both procedurally and substantively—the issues raised in the class action complaint first filed against Union Carbide in 1999 by Haseena Bi and several organisations representing the residents of Bhopal".&lt;ref name="chrono" /&gt;

In June 2010, seven former employees of UCIL, all Indian nationals and many in their 70s, were convicted of causing death by [[negligence]]: Keshub Mahindra, former non-executive chairman of Union Carbide India Limited; V. P. Gokhale, managing director; Kishore Kamdar, vice-president; J. Mukund, works manager; S. P. Chowdhury, production manager; K. V. Shetty, plant superintendent; and S. I. Qureshi, production assistant. They were each sentenced to two years imprisonment and fined [[Indian rupee|Rs.]]100,000 (US$2,124). All were released on bail shortly after the verdict.

US Federal class action litigation, ''Sahu v. Union Carbide and Warren Anderson'', was filed in 1999 under the [[Alien Tort Statute|U.S. Alien Torts Claims Act]] (ATCA), which provides for civil remedies for "crimes against humanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Pappu

==Long-term effects==
In 2018, ''[[The Atlantic]]'' called it the "world’s worst industrial disaster."&lt;ref name="MandavilliUnfolding"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mandavilli |first1=Apoorva |title=The World’s Worst Industrial Disaster Is Still Unfolding |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/07/the-worlds-worst-industrial-disaster-is-still-unfolding/560726/ |accessdate=10 July 2018 |publisher=[[The Atlantic]] |date=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-term health effects===
Some data about the health effects are still not available. The [[Indian Council of Medical Research]] (ICMR) was forbidden to publish health effect data until 1994.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;

A total of 36 wards were marked by the authorities as being "gas affected," affecting a population of 520,000. Of these, 200,000 were below 15 years of age, and 3,000 were pregnant women. The official immediate death toll was 2,259, and in 1991, 3,928 deaths had been officially certified. Ingrid Eckerman estimated 8,000 died within two weeks.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2001"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eckerman |first=Ingrid |title=Chemical industry and public health. Bhopal as an example |year=2001 |publisher=Nordic School of Public Health |location=Gothenburg, Sweden |url=http://www.lakareformiljon.org/images/stories/dokument/2009/bhopal_gas_disaster.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[government of Madhya Pradesh]] confirmed a total of 3,787 deaths related to the gas release.&lt;ref name="rehabilitation1"/&gt;

Later, the affected area was expanded to include 700,000 citizens. A government affidavit in 2006 stated the leak caused 558,125 injuries including 38,478 temporary partial injuries and approximately 3,900 severely and permanently disabling injuries.&lt;ref name="first3" /&gt;

A [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] of 80,021 exposed people was registered, along with a control group, a cohort of 15,931 people from areas not exposed to MIC. Nearly every year since 1986, they have answered the same questionnaire. It shows [[mortality rate|overmortality]] and [[Disease#Morbidity|overmorbidity]] in the exposed group. [[Bias]] and [[confounding factor]]s cannot be excluded from the study. Because of migration and other factors, 75% of the cohort is lost, as the ones who moved out are not followed.&lt;ref name=Eckerman2005 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sharma DC |journal=The Lancet |title=Bhopal study represents "missed opportunity" |year=2013 |volume=382 |issue=9908 |page=1870 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(13)62562-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of clinical studies are performed. The quality varies, but the different reports support each other.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; Studied and reported long term health effects are:
* Eyes: Chronic conjunctivitis, scars on cornea, corneal opacities, early cataracts
* Respiratory tracts: Obstructive and/or restrictive disease, pulmonary fibrosis, aggravation of TB and chronic bronchitis
* Neurological system: Impairment of memory, finer motor skills, numbness etc.
* Psychological problems: Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
* Children's health: Peri- and neonatal death rates increased. Failure to grow, intellectual impairment, etc.

Missing or insufficient fields for research are female reproduction, chromosomal aberrations, cancer, immune deficiency, neurological sequelae, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and children born after the disaster. Late cases that might never be highlighted are respiratory insufficiency, cardiac insufficiency (cor pulmonale), cancer and tuberculosis. Bhopal now has high rates of birth defects and records a [[miscarriage]] rate 7x higher than the national average.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

A 2014 report in ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' quotes a "spokesperson for the Bhopal Medical Appeal, which runs free health clinics for survivors" as saying "An estimated 120,000 to 150,000 survivors still struggle with serious medical conditions including nerve damage, growth problems, gynecological disorders, respiratory issues, birth defects, and elevated rates of cancer and tuberculosis."&lt;ref&gt;

===Health care===
The Government of India had focused primarily on increasing the hospital-based services for gas victims thus hospitals had been built after the disaster. When UCC wanted to sell its shares in UCIL, it was directed by the Supreme Court to finance a 500-bed hospital for the medical care of the survivors. Thus, Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research Centre (BMHRC) was inaugurated in 1998 and was obliged to give free care for survivors for eight years. BMHRC was a 350-bedded super speciality hospital where heart surgery and hemodialysis were done. There was a dearth of gynaecology, obstetrics and paediatrics. Eight mini-units (outreach health centres) were started and free health care for gas victims were to be offered until 2006.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; The management had also faced problems with strikes, and the quality of the health care being disputed.&lt;ref name=BMHT2005&gt;{{cite web|title=Bhopal Memorial Hospital closed indefinitely|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/07/04/stories/2005070401510500.htm|work=The Hindu|date=4 July 2005|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time line|url=http://www.bhopal.net/delhi-marchers/factsheets/BMHT%20sheet.pdf|publisher=Bhopal Memorial Hospital Trust|accessdate=30 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406192139/http://www.bhopal.net/delhi-marchers/factsheets/BMHT%20sheet.pdf|archivedate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sambhavna Trust]] is a charitable trust, registered in 1995, that gives [[modern medicine|modern]] as well as [[ayurvedic]] treatments to gas victims, free of charge.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sambhavna"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Sambhavna Trust |title=The Bhopal Medical appeal |url=http://www.bhopal.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental rehabilitation===
When the factory was closed in 1986, pipes, drums and tanks were sold. The MIC and the Sevin plants are still there, as are storages of different residues. Isolation material is falling down and spreading.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; The area around the plant was used as a dumping area for hazardous chemicals. In 1982 [[tubewell]]s in the vicinity of the UCIL factory had to be abandoned and tests in 1989 performed by UCC's laboratory revealed that soil and water samples collected from near the factory and inside the plant were toxic to fish.&lt;ref name="UCC1989"&gt;{{cite book |title=Presence of Toxic Ingredients in Soil/Water Samples Inside Plant Premises |location=USA |publisher=Union Carbide Corporation |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other studies had also shown polluted soil and groundwater in the area. Reported polluting compounds include [[1-naphthol]], [[naphthalene]], [[Carbaryl|Sevin]], [[tar|tarry residue]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], toxic [[organochlorine]]s, volatile organochlorine compounds, [[chromium]], copper, nickel, lead, [[hexachloroethane]], [[hexachlorobutadiene]], and the pesticide [[Hexachlorocyclohexane|HCH]].&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;

In order to provide safe drinking water to the population around the UCIL factory, Government of Madhya Pradesh presented a scheme for improvement of water supply.&lt;ref name="GovMP" /&gt; In December 2008, the Madhya Pradesh High Court decided that the toxic waste should be incinerated at [[Ankleshwar]] in Gujarat, which was met by protests from activists all over India.&lt;ref name="Times of India 16 Dec 2008"&gt;{{cite news |title=Carbide waste to go: HC |date=16 December 2008 |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-12-16/india/27937330_1_carbide-waste-toxic-waste-direction-for-safe-disposal |work= The Times of India|accessdate=7 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 June 2012, the Centre for incineration of toxic Bhopal waste agreed to pay {{INRConvert |250|m|nolink=yes}} to dispose of UCIL chemical plants waste in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-09/india/32140129_1_toxic-waste-gom-babulal-gaur | title=Centre to pay Rs 25 crore to dump Bhopal waste in Germany| date=9 June 2012|accessdate=30 August 2012|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 August 2012, Supreme court directed the Union and Madhya Pradesh Governments to take immediate steps for disposal of toxic waste lying around and inside the factory within six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=J.|last=Venkatesan|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3747020.ece |title=Supreme Court orders disposal of Bhopal toxic waste in six months |date=10 August 2012|accessdate=30 August 2012|newspaper=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A U.S. court rejected the lawsuit blaming UCC for causing soil and water pollution around the site of the plant and ruled that responsibility for remedial measures or related claims rested with the State Government and not with UCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-28/india/32456094_1_ucil-union-carbide-india-ucc| title=US court absolves Union Carbide of liability in Bhopal tragedy | date=28 June 2012|accessdate=30 August 2012|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the state government invited various Indian architects to enter their "concept for development of a memorial complex for Bhopal gas tragedy victims at the site of Union Carbide". In 2011, a conference was held on the site, with participants from European universities which was aimed for the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bhopal2011.in/publication.php#c |title=Bhopal 2011 – landscapes of memory |publisher=SpaceMatters, India with Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) |editors = Amritha Ballal, Jan af Geijerstam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Curating a Bhopal People's Movement: An Opportunity for Indian Museums |journal=Curator the Museum Journal |author=Lakshmi R |date=9 January 2012 |doi=10.1111/j.2151-6952.2011.00119.x |volume=55 |pages=35–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupational and habitation rehabilitation===
33 of the 50 planned work-sheds for gas victims started. All except one was closed down by 1992. 1986, the MP government invested in the Special Industrial Area Bhopal. 152 of the planned 200 work sheds were built and in 2000, 16 were partially functioning. It was estimated that 50,000 persons need alternative jobs, and that less than 100 gas victims had found regular employment under the government's scheme. The government also planned 2,486 flats in two- and four-story buildings in what is called the "widow's colony" outside Bhopal. The water did not reach the upper floors and it was not possible to keep cattle which were their primary occupation. Infrastructure like buses, schools, etc. were missing for at least a decade.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;

===Economic rehabilitation===
Immediate relieves were decided two days after the tragedy. Relief measures commenced in 1985 when food was distributed for a short period along with ration cards.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; [[Madhya Pradesh]] government's finance department allocated {{INRConvert|874|m}} for victim relief in July 1985.&lt;ref name="India1985_1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Press Institute of India|title=Data India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pn9DAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=1 August 2012|year=1985|publisher=Press Institute of India|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="India1985_2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Press Institute of India|title=Data India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pn9DAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=1 August 2012|year=1985|publisher=Press Institute of India|page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widow pension of {{INRConvert|200}}/per month (later {{INRConvert|750}}) were provided. The government also decided to pay {{INRConvert|1500}} to families with monthly income {{INRConvert|500}} or less. As a result of the interim relief, more children were able to attend school, more money was spent on treatment and food, and housing also eventually improved. From 1990 interim relief of {{INRConvert|200}} was paid to everyone in the family who was born before the disaster.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;

The final compensation, including interim relief for personal injury was for the majority {{INRConvert|25|k}}. For death claim, the average sum paid out was {{INRConvert|62|k}}. Each claimant were to be categorised by a doctor. In court, the claimants were expected to prove "beyond reasonable doubt" that death or injury in each case was attributable to exposure. In 1992, 44 percent of the claimants still had to be medically examined.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;

By the end of October 2003, according to the Bhopal Gas Tragedy Relief and Rehabilitation Department, compensation had been awarded to 554,895 people for injuries received and 15,310 survivors of those killed. The average amount to families of the dead was $2,200.&lt;ref name="broughton" /&gt;

In 2007, 1,029,517 cases were registered and decided. Number of awarded cases were 574,304 and number of rejected cases 455,213. Total compensation awarded was {{INRConvert|15465|m}}.&lt;ref name="GovMP"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bhopal Gas Tragedy Relief and Rehabilitation Department |publisher=Government of Madhya Pradesh|accessdate=30 August 2012|date=5 December 2008 |url=http://www.mp.gov.in/bgtrrdmp/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 June 2010, the [[Union Cabinet]] of the [[Government of India]] approved a {{INRConvert|12650|m}} aid package which would be funded by Indian taxpayers through the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_bhopal-gas-tragedy-extra-aid-to-help-just-42000-victims_1400833 |title=Bhopal gas tragedy: Extra aid to help just 42,000 victims&amp;nbsp;— India&amp;nbsp;— DNA |publisher=DNA news |date=24 June 2010 |accessdate=28 August 2012|first=Anil|last=Anand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other impacts===
In 1985, [[Henry Waxman]], a California Democrat, called for a U.S. government inquiry into the Bhopal disaster, which resulted in U.S. legislation regarding the accidental release of toxic chemicals in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BP, Bhopal and the humble Indian brinjal|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/BP-Bhopal-and-the-humble-Indian-brinjal/Article1-561254.aspx|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130125081836/http://www.hindustantimes.com/BP-Bhopal-and-the-humble-Indian-brinjal/Article1-561254.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 January 2013|accessdate=26 June 2010|newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=22 June 2010|author=Dipankar De Sarkar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of the disaster: overview==
There are two main lines of argument involving the disaster.
The "Corporate Negligence" point of view argues that the disaster was caused by a potent combination of under-maintained and decaying facilities, a weak attitude towards safety, and an undertrained workforce, culminating in worker actions that inadvertently enabled water to penetrate the MIC tanks in the absence of properly working safeguards.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2001" /&gt;

The "Worker Sabotage" point of view argues that it was not physically possible for the water to enter the tank without concerted human effort, and that extensive testimony and engineering analysis leads to a conclusion that water entered the tank when a rogue individual employee hooked a water hose directly to an empty valve on the side of the tank. This point of view further argues that the Indian government took extensive actions to hide this possibility in order to attach blame to UCC.&lt;ref name="Kalelkar1988" /&gt;

Theories differ as to how the water entered the tank. At the time, workers were cleaning out a clogged pipe with water about 400 feet from the tank. They claimed that they were not told to isolate the tank with a pipe slip-blind plate. The operators assumed that owing to bad maintenance and leaking valves, it was possible for the water to leak into the tank.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chouhan"/&gt;

This water entry route could not be reproduced despite strenuous efforts by motivated parties.&lt;ref name="Weisman NYT Dec 1985 p.5"&gt;{{cite news|author=Steven R. Weisman|title=Bhopal a Year Later: An Eerie Silence|publisher=The New York Times|date=5 December 1985|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; UCC claims that a "disgruntled worker" deliberately connecting a hose to a pressure gauge connection was the real cause.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalelkar1988" /&gt;

Early the next morning, a UCIL manager asked the instrument engineer to replace the gauge. UCIL's investigation team found no evidence of the necessary connection; the investigation was totally controlled by the government, denying UCC investigators access to the tank or interviews with the operators.&lt;ref name="Kalelkar1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tradeunion1985" /&gt;

===Causes of the disaster: The "corporate negligence" argument===

This point of view argues that management (and to some extent, local government) underinvested in safety, which allowed for a dangerous working environment to develop. Factors cited include the filling of the MIC tanks beyond recommended levels, poor maintenance after the plant ceased MIC production at the end of 1984, allowing several safety systems to be inoperable due to poor maintenance, and switching off safety systems to save money— including the MIC tank refrigeration system which could have mitigated the disaster severity, and non-existent catastrophe management plans.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2001" /&gt; Other factors identified by government inquiries included undersized safety devices and the dependence on manual operations.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; Specific plant management deficiencies that were identified include the lack of skilled operators, reduction of safety management, insufficient maintenance, and inadequate emergency action plans.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2006"/&gt;

'''Underinvestment'''

Underinvestment is cited as contributing to an environment.   In attempts to reduce expenses, $1.25 million of cuts were placed upon the plant which affected the factory's employees and their conditions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Kurzman argues that "cuts&amp;nbsp;... meant less stringent quality control and thus looser safety rules. A pipe leaked? Don't replace it, employees said they were told&amp;nbsp;... MIC workers needed more training? They could do with less. Promotions were halted, seriously affecting employee morale and driving some of the most skilled&amp;nbsp;... elsewhere".&lt;ref name="Kurzman1987"&gt;Kurzman (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Workers were forced to use English manuals, even though only a few had a grasp of the language.&lt;ref name="Chouhan"&gt;{{cite book |author=Chouhan TR |origyear=1994|year=2004 |title=Bhopal: the Inside Story — Carbide Workers Speak Out on the World's Worst Industrial Disaster. |location=US and India |publisher=The Apex Press and Other India Press |id=  and |display-authors=etal|isbn=978-1-891843-30-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cassels"&gt;Cassels (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent research highlights a gradual deterioration of safety practices in regard to the MIC, which had become less relevant to plant operations. By 1984, only six of the original twelve operators were still working with MIC and the number of supervisory personnel had also been halved. No maintenance supervisor was placed on the night shift and instrument readings were taken every two hours, rather than the previous and required one-hour readings.&lt;ref name="Chouhan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurzman1987" /&gt; Workers made complaints about the cuts through their union but were ignored. One employee was fired after going on a 15-day hunger strike. 70% of the plant's employees were fined before the disaster for refusing to deviate from the proper safety regulations under pressure from the management.&lt;ref name="Chouhan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurzman1987" /&gt;

In addition, some observers, such as those writing in the Trade Environmental Database (TED) Case Studies as part of the Mandala Project from [[American University]], have pointed to "serious communication problems and management gaps between Union Carbide and its Indian operation", characterised by "the parent {{sic|companies}} hands-off approach to its overseas operation" and "cross-cultural barriers".&lt;ref name="TED"&gt;Mandala Project (1996), Trade Environmental Database (TED) Case Study 233.

'''Adequacy of equipment and safety regulations'''

The factory was not well equipped to handle the gas created by the sudden addition of water to the MIC tank. The MIC tank alarms had not been working for four years and there was only one manual back-up system, compared to a four-stage system used in the United States.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Eckerman2001/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chouhan" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lepowski /&gt; The flare tower and several vent gas scrubbers had been out of service for five months before the disaster. Only one gas scrubber was operating: it could not treat such a large amount of MIC with [[sodium hydroxide]] (caustic soda), which would have brought the concentration down to a safe level.&lt;ref name=Lepowski/&gt; The flare tower could only handle a quarter of the gas that leaked in 1984, and moreover it was out of order at the time of the incident.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chouhan" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir&gt;Weir (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce energy costs, the refrigeration system was idle. The MIC was kept at 20 degrees Celsius, not the 4.5 degrees advised by the manual.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chouhan" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lepowski/&gt; Even the steam boiler, intended to clean the pipes, was non-operational for unknown reasons.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chouhan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lepowski" /&gt; Slip-blind plates that would have prevented water from pipes being cleaned from leaking into the MIC tanks, had the valves been faulty, were not installed and their installation had been omitted from the cleaning checklist.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chouhan" /&gt; As MIC is water-soluble, [[deluge gun]]s were in place to contain escaping gases from the stack. The water pressure was too weak for the guns to spray high enough to reach the gas which would have reduced the concentration of escaping gas significantly.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chouhan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lepowski"&gt;Lepowski&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to it, carbon steel valves were used at the factory, even though they were known to corrode when exposed to acid.&lt;ref name="Kovel" /&gt;

According to the operators, the MIC tank pressure gauge had been malfunctioning for roughly a week. Other tanks were used, rather than repairing the gauge. The build-up in temperature and pressure is believed to have affected the magnitude of the gas release.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chouhan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lepowski" /&gt; UCC admitted in their own investigation report that most of the safety systems were not functioning on the night of 3 December 1984.&lt;ref name="UCC1985"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bhopal Methyl Isocyanate Incident. Investigation Team Report |location=Danbury, CT |publisher=Union Carbide Corporation |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the MIC plant, following government guidelines, was "Indianized" by UCIL engineers to maximise the use of indigenous materials and products. Mumbai-based Humphreys and Glasgow Consultants Pvt. Ltd., were the main consultants, [[Larsen &amp; Toubro]] fabricated the MIC storage tanks, and Taylor of India Ltd. provided the instrumentation.&lt;ref name=D&gt;D'Silva, The Black Box of Bhopal (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, during civil action suits in India, it emerged that the plant was not prepared for problems. No action plans had been established to cope with incidents of this magnitude. This included not informing local authorities of the quantities or dangers of chemicals used and manufactured at Bhopal.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kovel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chouhan" /&gt;

'''Safety audits'''

Safety audits were done every year in the US and European UCC plants, but only every two years in other parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="varadarajan1985" /&gt; Before a "Business Confidential" safety audit by UCC in May 1982, the senior officials of the corporation were well aware of "a total of 61 hazards, 30 of them major and 11 minor in the dangerous phosgene/methyl isocyanate units" in Bhopal.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Bhopal Gas Tragedy 1984- ? A report from the Sambhavna Trust, Bhopal, India |year=1998 |publisher=Bhopal People's Health and Documentation clinic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the audit 1982, it was indicated that worker performance was below standards.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tradeunion1985" /&gt; Ten major concerns were listed.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; UCIL prepared an action plan, but UCC never sent a follow-up team to Bhopal. Many of the items in the 1982 report were temporarily fixed, but by 1984, conditions had again deteriorated.&lt;ref name="tradeunion1985" /&gt; In September 1984, an internal UCC report on the West Virginia plant in the USA revealed a number of defects and malfunctions. It warned that "a runaway reaction could occur in the MIC unit storage tanks, and that the planned response would not be timely or effective enough to prevent catastrophic failure of the tanks". This report was never forwarded to the Bhopal plant, although the main design was the same.&lt;ref name="Lapierre"&gt;{{cite book |title=It Was Five Past Midnight in Bhopal |authors=Lapierre D, Moro J |year=2001 |publisher=Full Circle Publishing |location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes of the disaster: the "disgruntled employee sabotage" case===
Now owned by [[Dow Chemical Company]], Union Carbide maintains a website dedicated to the tragedy and claims that the incident was the result of sabotage, stating that sufficient safety systems were in place and operative to prevent the intrusion of water.&lt;ref name="ucs"&gt;{{cite web |title=Statement of Union Carbide Corporation Regarding the Bhopal Tragedy |url=http://www.bhopal.com/union-carbide-statements |publisher=Bhopal Information Center |accessdate=30 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904032258/http://www.bhopal.com/union-carbide-statements |archivedate=4 September 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The impossibility of the "negligence" argument'''

According to the "Corporate Negligence" argument, workers had been cleaning out pipes with water nearby. This water was diverted due to a combination of improper maintenance, leaking and clogging, and eventually ended up in the MIC storage tank. Indian scientists also suggested that additional water might have been introduced as a "back-flow" from a defectively designed vent-gas scrubber. None of these theoretical routes of entry were ever successfully demonstrated during tests by the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI) and UCIL engineers.&lt;ref name="Chouhan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tradeunion1985"&gt;[http://www.bhopal.net/oldsite/documentlibrary/unionreport1985.html The Trade Union Report on Bhopal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715082437/http://www.bhopal.net/oldsite/documentlibrary/unionreport1985.html |date=15 July 2009 }}, Geneva, Switzerland: ICFTU-ICEF, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="varadarajan1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Varadarajan S |title=Report on Scientific Studies on the Factors Related to Bhopal Toxic Gas Leakage |publisher=Indian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research |location=New Delhi |year=1985|url=https://bhopalgasdisaster.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/csir-report-on-scientific-studies-december-1985.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UCCreport1985"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bhopal Methyl Isocyanate Incident |year=1985 |publisher=Union Carbide Corporation |location=Danbury, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Union Carbide commissioned analysis conducted by [[Arthur D. Little]] claims that the Negligence argument was impossible for several tangible reasons:&lt;ref name="Kalelkar1988" /&gt;
# The pipes being used by the nearby workers were only 1/2 inch in diameter and were physically incapable of producing enough hydraulic pressure to raise water the more than 10 feet that would have been necessary to enable the water to "backflow" into the MIC tank.
# A key intermediate valve would have had to be open for the Negligence argument to apply. This valve was "tagged" closed, meaning that it had been inspected and found to be closed. While it is possible for open valves to clog over time, the only way a closed valve allows penetration is if there is leakage, and 1985 tests carried out by the government of India found this valve to be non-leaking.
# In order for water to have reached the MIC tank from the pipe-cleaning area, it would have had to flow through a significant network of pipes ranging from 6 to 8 inches in diameter, before rising ten feet and flowing into the MIC tank. Had this occurred, most of the water that was in those pipes at the time the tank had its critical reaction would have remained in those pipes, as there was no drain for them. Investigation by the Indian government in 1985 revealed that the pipes were bone dry.

===The argument for sabotage===
The Union Carbide commissioned Arthur D. Little report concludes that it is likely that a single employee secretly and deliberately introduced a large amount of water into the MIC tank by removing a meter and connecting a water hose directly to the tank through the metering port.&lt;ref name="Kalelkar1988"&gt;{{cite book |title=Investigation of Large-magnitude Incidents: Bhopal as a Case Study |url=http://bhopal.bard.edu/resources/research.php?action=getfile&amp;id=180633 |vauthors=Kalelkar AS, Little AD |year=1988 |location=London |publisher=Presented at the Institution of Chemical Engineers conference on preventing major chemical accidents. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208044210/http://bhopal.bard.edu/resources/research.php?action=getfile&amp;id=180633 |archivedate=8 December 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCC claims the plant staff falsified numerous records to distance themselves from the incident and absolve themselves of blame, and that the Indian Government impeded its investigation and declined to prosecute the employee responsible, presumably because that would weaken its allegations of negligence by Union Carbide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bhopal.com/faq.htm |title=Frequently Asked Questions |date=November 2009 |work=Bhopal Information Center |publisher=Union Carbide Corporation |accessdate=4 April 2010 |quote=The Indian authorities are well aware of the identity of the employee [who sabotaged the plant] and the nature of the evidence against him. Indian authorities refused to pursue this individual because they, as litigants, were not interested in proving that anyone other than Union Carbide was to blame for the tragedy. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408133152/http://www.bhopal.com/faq.htm |archivedate=8 April 2010 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence in favor of this point of view includes:
# A key witness (the "tea boy") testified that when he entered the control room at 12:15 am, prior to the disaster, the "atmosphere was tense and quiet".
# Another key witness (the "instrument supervisor") testified that when he arrived at the scene immediately following the incident, he noticed that the local pressure indicator on the critical Tank 610 was missing, and that he had found a hose lying next to the empty manhead created by the missing pressure indicator, and that the hose had had water running out of it.
# This testimony was corroborated by other witnesses.
# Graphological analysis revealed major attempts to alter logfiles and destroy log evidence.
# Other logfiles show that the control team had attempted to purge 1 ton of material out of Tank 610 immediately prior to the disaster. An attempt was then made to cover up this transfer via log alteration. Water is heavier than MIC, and the transfer line is attached to the bottom of the tank. The Arthur D. Little report concludes from this that the transfer was an effort to transfer water out of Tank 610 that had been discovered there.
# A third key witness (the "off-duty employee of another unit") stated that "he had been told by a close friend of one of the MIC operators that water had entered through a tube that had been connected to the tank." This had been discovered by the other MIC operators (so the story was recounted) who then tried to open and close valves to prevent the release.
# A fourth key witness (the "operator from a different unit") stated that after the release, two MIC operators had told him that water had entered the tank through a pressure gauge.

The Little report argues that this evidence demonstrates that the following chronology took place:
* At 10:20pm, the tank was at normal pressure, indicating the absence of water.
* At 10:45pm, a shift change took place, after which the MIC storage area "would be completely deserted".
* During this period, a "disgruntled operator entered the storage area and hooked up one of the readily available rubber water hoses to Tank 610, with the intention of contaminating and spoiling the tank's contents."
* Water began to flow, beginning the chemical reaction that caused the disaster.
* After midnight, control room operators saw the pressure rising and realized there was a problem with Tank 610. They discovered the water connection, and decided to transfer one ton of the contents out to try and remove the water.
* The disaster then occurred, a major release of poisonous gas.
* The cover-up activities discovered during the investigation then took place.
* After over 30 years, S.P. Choudhary, former MIC Production Manager, broke the silence and told the truth about the disaster that it was not an accident but the result of a sabotage that claimed thousands of lives, a former official of the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) told the district and sessions court.
The theory of design defect was floated by the central government in its endeavour to do justice to the victims of the tragedy. Everyone else who was part of investigations into the case "just toed the line of the central government....
The government and the CBI suppressed the actual truth and saved the real perpetrators of the crime, the counsel, Anirban Roy told the court."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=21 July 2016|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/bhopal-gas-tragedy-not-an-accident-but-sabotage-says-convicted-ucil-official/story-Q87kJ40p7pKS9sJd5udlmI.html|title=gas tradegy not an accident but sabotage, says convicted UCIL official}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|website=[[Times of India]]|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/Gas-tragedy-Counsel-cries-sabotage/articleshow/54504407.cms|title=Gas tragedy Counsel cries sabotage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, appearing for two accused S P Chaudhary and J Mukund, their advocate Anirban Roy told the district court on Monday that disgruntled plant operator M L Verma was behind the sabotage because he was unhappy with his seniors. Roy argued that the theory about defects in the plant causing the mishap was imaginary. He said truth had always been suppressed and it's for the CBI to bring it out.
The counsel argued that there were discrepancies in the statements given by persons who were operating the plant at that time but the central agency chose not to investigate the case properly because it always wanted to prove that it was a mishap, and not sabotage. He alleged that Verma was unhappy with Chaudhary and Mukund.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |website=[[Indian Express]] |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/bhopal-gas-tragedy-dow-chemical-1984-gas-tragedy-trial-madhya-pradesh-union-carbide-india-limited-4936270/ |title= Bhopal Gas tragedy: In court, defence names former employee as 'saboteur'|date=13 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional Union Carbide actions==
The corporation denied the claim that the valves on the tank were malfunctioning, and claimed that the documented evidence gathered after the incident showed that the valve close to the plant's water-washing operation was closed and was leak-tight. Furthermore, process safety systems had prevented water from entering the tank by accident. Carbide states that the safety concerns identified in 1982 were all allayed before 1984 and had nothing to do with the incident.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bhopal.com/faq.htm |publisher=Bhopal Information Center, UCC |title=Frequently Asked Questions |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408133152/http://www.bhopal.com/faq.htm |archivedate=8 April 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company admitted that the safety systems in place would not have been able to prevent a chemical reaction of that magnitude from causing a leak. According to Carbide, "in designing the plant's safety systems, a chemical reaction of this magnitude was not factored in" because "the tank's gas storage system was designed to automatically prevent such a large amount of water from being inadvertently introduced into the system" and "process safety systems—in place and operational—would have prevented water from entering the tank by accident". Instead, they claim that "employee sabotage—not faulty design or operation—was the cause of the tragedy".&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt;

'''Tactical response'''

The company stresses the immediate action taken after the disaster and its continued commitment to helping the victims. On 4 December, the day following the leak, Union Carbide sent material aid and several international medical experts to assist the medical facilities in Bhopal.&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt;

'''Financial response'''

The primary financial restitution paid by UCC was negotiated in 1989, when the Indian Supreme Court approved a settlement of US$470 million ({{INRConvert|1055|c|year=1989}}). This amount was immediately paid by UCC to the Indian government. The company states that the restitution paid "was $120 million more than plaintiffs' lawyers had told U.S. courts was fair" and that the Indian Supreme Court stated in its opinion that "compensation levels under the settlement were far greater than would normally be payable under Indian law."&lt;ref name="irs" /&gt;

In the immediate aftermath of the disaster, Union Carbide states on its website that it put $2 million into the Indian prime minister's immediate disaster relief fund on 11 December 1984.&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt; The corporation established the Employees' Bhopal Relief Fund in February 1985, which raised more than {{Nowrap|$5 million}} for immediate relief.&lt;ref name="chrono"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Bhopal Information Center, UCC |title=Chronology |accessdate=30 August 2012 |url=http://www.bhopal.com/chrono.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010924010814/http://www.bhopal.com/chrono.htm |archivedate=24 September 2001  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Union Carbide, in August 1987, they made an additional {{Nowrap|$4.6 million}} in humanitarian interim relief available.&lt;ref name="chrono" /&gt;

Union Carbide stated that it also undertook several steps to provide continuing aid to the victims of the Bhopal disaster. The sale of its 50.9 percent interest in UCIL in April 1992 and establishment of a charitable trust to contribute to the building of a local hospital. The sale was finalised in November 1994. The hospital was begun in October 1995 and was opened in 2001. The company provided a fund with around {{Nowrap|$90 million}} from sale of its UCIL stock. In 1991, the trust had amounted approximately {{Nowrap|$100 million}}. The hospital catered for the treatment of heart, lung and eye problems.&lt;ref name="ucs" /&gt; UCC also provided a $2.2 million grant to [[Arizona State University]] to establish a vocational-technical center in Bhopal, which was opened, but was later closed by the state government.&lt;ref name="irs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bhopal.com/irs.htm |publisher=Bhopal Information Center, UCC |title=Incident Response and Settlement |accessdate=30 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103235052/http://www.bhopal.com/irs.htm |archivedate=3 January 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also donated $5 million to the [[Indian Red Cross]] after the disaster.&lt;ref name="irs" /&gt; They also developed a [[Responsible Care]] system with other members of the chemical industry as a response to the Bhopal crisis, which was designed to help prevent such an event in the future.&lt;ref name="chrono" /&gt;

===Charges against UCC and UCIL employees===
UCC chairman and CEO Warren Anderson was arrested and released on bail by the Madhya Pradesh Police in Bhopal on 7 December 1984. Anderson was taken to UCC's house after which he was released six hours later on $2,100 bail and flown out on a government plane. These actions were allegedly taken under the direction of then chief secretary of the state, who was possibly instructed from chief minister's office, who himself flew out of Bhopal immediately.&lt;ref name="Escapes on Bhopal disaster 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebhopalpost.com/index.php/2012/07/when-the-gas-leaked-arjun-flew-away-to-pray/|title=When the gas leaked, Arjun flew away to pray|publisher=The Bhopal Post| date=7 July 2012|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Escapes on Bhopal disaster 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120704/jsp/nation/story_15688988.jsp#.UBj6JmHaabs |title=When the gas leaked, Arjun flew away to pray|work=The Telegraph|date=3 July 2012|first=Rasheed |last=Kidwai|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Escapes on Bhopal disaster 3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-06-10/india/28318396_1_warren-anderson-state-plane-chief-secretary|first=Suchandana|last=Gupta|title=Chief secretary told me to let Anderson go: Ex- Collector|work=The Times of India|date=10 June 2010|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1987, the [[Indian government]] summoned Anderson, eight other executives and two company affiliates with [[homicide]] charges to appear in Indian court.&lt;ref name="nytimes88"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/17/business/india-acts-in-carbide-case.html|title=India Acts in Carbide Case|work=The New York Times|date=17 May 1988|accessdate=30 August 2012|author=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Union Carbide said the company is not under Indian jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="nytimes88" /&gt;

The area around the plant was used as a dumping ground for hazardous chemicals and by 1982 water wells in the vicinity of the UCIL factory had to be abandoned.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; UCC states that "after the incident, UCIL began clean-up work at the site under the direction of Indian central and state government authorities", which was continued after 1994 by the successor to UCIL. The successor, Eveready Industries India, Limited (EIIL), ended cleanup on the site in 1998, when it terminated its 99-year lease and turned over control of the site to the state government of Madhya Pradesh.&lt;ref name="chrono" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ucs" /&gt;

UCC's laboratory tests in 1989 revealed that soil and water samples collected from near the factory were toxic to fish. Twenty-one areas inside the plant were reported to be highly polluted. In 1991 the municipal authorities declared that water from over 100 wells was hazardous for health if used for drinking.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; In 1994 it was reported that 21% of the factory premises were seriously contaminated with chemicals.&lt;ref name="UCC1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Labunska"&gt;Labunska et al. (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="down"&gt;Down to Earth (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1999, studies made by [[Greenpeace]] and others from soil, groundwater, [[Water well|well water]] and vegetables from the residential areas around UCIL and from the UCIL factory area show contamination with a range of toxic heavy metals and chemical compounds. Substances found, according to the reports, are [[1-Naphthol|naphthol]], [[naphthalene]], Sevin, tarry residues, [[1-naphthol|alpha naphthol]], mercury, [[organochlorines]], [[chromium]], copper, nickel, lead, hexachlorethane, [[hexachlorobutadiene]], pesticide HCH ([[Hexachlorocyclohexane|BHC]]), [[volatile organic compound]]s and halo-organics.&lt;ref name="Labunska" /&gt;&lt;ref name="down" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stringer"&gt;Stringer et al. (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="srishti"&gt;Srishti (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these contaminants were also found in breast milk of women living near the area.&lt;ref name=BMA /&gt;
Soil tests were conducted by Greenpeace in 1999. One sample (IT9012) from "sediment collected from drain under former Sevin plant" showed mercury levels to be at "20,000 and {{Nowrap|6 million}} times" higher than expected levels. Organochlorine compounds at elevated levels were also present in groundwater collected from (sample IT9040) a 4.4 meter depth "bore-hole within the former UCIL site". This sample was obtained from a source posted with a warning sign which read "Water unfit for consumption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://webdrive.service.emory.edu/users/vdhara/www.BhopalPublications/Environmental%20Health/Greenpeace%20Bhopal%20Report.pdf |author1=Labunska I |author2=Stephenson A |author3=Brigden K |author4=Stringer R |author5=Santillo D |author6=Johnston P.A. |year=1999 |title=The Bhopal Legacy.

In 2010, a British photojournalist who ventured into the abandoned [[Union Carbide]] factory to investigate allegations of abandoned, leaking toxins, was hospitalized in Bhopal for a week after he was exposed to the chemicals.

==In popular culture==
In 1999, a Hindi film dealing with the tragedy, ''[[Bhopal Express (film)|Bhopal Express]]'', was released. The film stars [[Kay Kay Menon]] and [[Naseeruddin Shah]].

[[Amulya Malladi]]'s 2002 novel ''A Breath of Fresh Air'' relates the story of a mother and son who develop health issues as a result of exposure to gas at Bhopal. The book is based on Malladi's recollections of Bhopal during the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Athitakis|first1=Mark|title=A Breath of Fresh Air|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/a-breath-of-fresh-air/Content?oid=2145552|publisher=San Francisco Weekly|date=31 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indra Sinha]] released ''[[Animal's People]]'' in 2007. The novel tells the story of a boy who is born with a spinal condition due to effects of the gas. The book was shortlisted for the [[Man Booker Prize]].

In 2014, to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the disaster, historical-drama ''[[Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain]]'' was released, starring [[Martin Sheen]] as Union Carbide CEO [[Warren Anderson (American businessman)|Warren Anderson]], [[Kal Penn]], and [[Mischa Barton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-bhopal-prayer-for-rain-review-20141114-story.html |author=Martin Tsai |title=Review 'Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain' an effective cautionary tale |work=Los Angeles Times |date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arundhati Roy]]'s 2017 novel ''[[The Ministry of Utmost Happiness]]'' which deals with many contemporary political issues in India also features several characters still dealing with the aftermath of the gas leak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Arundhati|last=Roy|title=The Ministry of Utmost Happiness|page=135|publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]]|year=2017|title-link=The Ministry of Utmost Happiness}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Since 1984, individual activists have played a role in the aftermath of the tragedy. The best-known is [[Satinath Sarangi]] (Sathyu), a [[Metallurgic engineering|metallurgic engineer]] who arrived at Bhopal the day after the leakage. He founded several activist groups, as well as [[Sambhavna Trust]], the clinic for gas affected patients, where he is the manager.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; Other activists include Rashida Bee and Champa Devi Shukla, who received the [[Goldman Prize]] in 2004, Abdul Jabbar and [[Rachna Dhingra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/2004/Asia|title=Rashida Bee &amp; Champa Devi Shukla|work=Goldman Environmental Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anindianmuslim.com/2009/12/crusader-for-victims-truth-of-bhopal.html |title=An Indian Muslim's Blog: News, Views &amp; Urdu Poetry Website: Crusader for Victims: The Truth of Bhopal Gas Tragedy and its Aftermath-Part III |publisher=Anindianmuslim.com |date=9 December 2009 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local activism===
Soon after the accident, representatives from different activist groups arrived. The activists worked on organising the gas victims, which led to violent repression from the police and the government.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;

Numerous actions have been performed: demonstrations, sit-ins, [[hunger strikes]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, marches combined with pamphlets, books, and articles. Every anniversary, actions are performed. Often these include marches around Old Bhopal, ending with burning an [[effigy]] of [[Warren Anderson (American businessman)|Warren Anderson]].

===International activism===
Cooperation with international NGOs including [http://www.pan-uk.org/ Pesticide Action Network UK] and [http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/campaigns/toxics/justice-for-bhopal/ Greenpeace] started soon after the tragedy. One of the earliest reports is the Trade Union report from ILO 1985.&lt;ref name="tradeunion1985"/&gt;

In 1992, a session of the [[Permanent Peoples' Tribunal]] on Industrial Hazards and Human Rights took place in Bhopal, and in 1996, the [https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/212/45285.html "Charter on Industrial Hazards and Human Rights"] was adopted.

In 1994, the [[International Medical Commission on Bhopal]] (IMCB) met in Bhopal. Their work contributed to long term health effects being officially recognised.

Important international actions have been the tour to Europe and United States in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Media release – 23 April 2004 |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/media-center/news-releases/bhopal-victims-warn-u-s-gover/ |title=Bhopal Victims Warn U.S. Government and Dow Chemical of Impending Catastrophe |publisher=Greenpeace |date=23 April 2004 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the marches to Delhi in 2006 and 2008, all including hunger strikes, and the Bhopal Europe Bus Tour in 2009.

===Activist organisations===
At least 14 different NGOs were immediately engaged.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; The first disaster reports were published by activist organisations, [[Eklavya]] and the [[Delhi Science Forum]].

Around ten local organisations, engaged on long term, have been identified. Two of the most active organisations are the women's organisations—Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila-Stationery Karmachari Sangh and Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Udyog Sangthan.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;

More than 15 national organisations have been engaged along with a number of international organisations.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;

Some of the organisations are:
* [[International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal]] (ICJB), coordinates international activities.
* [[Bhopal Medical Appeal]], collects funds for the Sambhavna Trust.
* [[Sambhavna Trust]] or Bhopal People's Health and Documentation Clinic. Provides medical care for gas affected patients and those living in water-contaminated area.
* [[Chingari Trust]], provides medical care for children being born in Bhopal with malformations and brain damages.
* [[Students for Bhopal]], based in USA.
* [[International Medical Commission on Bhopal]], provided medical information 1994–2000.

===Settlement fund hoax===

On 3 December 2004, the twentieth anniversary of the disaster, a man falsely claiming to be a Dow representative named Jude Finisterra was interviewed on [[BBC World News]]. He claimed that the company had agreed to clean up the site and compensate those harmed in the incident, by liquidating Union Carbide for {{Nowrap|US$12 billion}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dow Does The Right Thing|url=http://theyesmen.org/hijinks/bbcbhopal|publisher=The Yes Men|accessdate=30 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923175638/http://theyesmen.org/hijinks/bbcbhopal|archivedate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dow|url=http://theyesmen.org/hijinks/dow|publisher=The Yes Men|accessdate=30 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810225225/http://theyesmen.org/hijinks/dow|archivedate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dow quickly issued a statement saying that they had no employee by that name—that he was an impostor, not affiliated with Dow, and that his claims were a hoax. The BBC later broadcast a correction and an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=66&amp;ItemID=6795|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041216065428/http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=66&amp;ItemID=6795|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 December 2004|title=Corporate Responsibility|date=5 December 2004|publisher=Zmag.org|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jude Finisterra was actually [[Jacque Servin|Andy Bichlbaum]], a member of the activist prankster group [[The Yes Men]]. In 2002, The Yes Men issued a fake press release explaining why Dow refused to take responsibility for the disaster and started up a website, at "DowEthics.com", designed to look like the real Dow website, but containing hoax information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theyesmen.org/hijinks/dow/ |title=The Yes Men |publisher=The Yes Men |date=12 May 2005 |accessdate=28 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810225225/http://theyesmen.org/hijinks/dow |archivedate=10 August 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monitoring of Bhopal activists===
The [[2012 Stratfor email leak|release of an email cache]] related to intelligence research organisation [[Stratfor]] was leaked by [[WikiLeaks]] on 27 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/date/2011.html |title=Wikileaks GI release 2011 |publisher=Wikileaks |accessdate=28 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827105410/https://www.wikileaks.org/gifiles/date/2011.html |archivedate=27 August 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It revealed that Dow Chemical had engaged Stratfor to spy on the public and personal lives of activists involved in the Bhopal disaster, including the [[Yes Men]]. E-mails to Dow representatives from hired security analysts list the [[YouTube]] videos liked, Twitter and Facebook posts made and the public appearances of these activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/407784_dow-confidential-bhopal-monitoring-report-friday-november-18.html |title=An example email report |publisher=Wikileaks |accessdate=28 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827105932/http://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/407784_dow-confidential-bhopal-monitoring-report-friday-november-18.html |archivedate=27 August 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists, film-makers and authors who were investigating Bhopal and covering the issue of ongoing contamination, such as Jack Laurenson and Max Carlson, were also placed under surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/attach/33/33827_Social%20media%2002-23-11%20BMA%20-%20FB.pdf|title=Wikileaks Stratfor Surveillance|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/39/391344_bhopal-update-03-31-11-media-.html|title=The Global Intelligence Files - Bhopal update - 03-31-11 Media|website=wikileaks.org|language=en|access-date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stratfor released a statement condemning the revelation by Wikileaks while neither confirming nor denying the accuracy of the reports, and would only state that it had acted within the bounds of the law. Dow Chemical also refrained to comment on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=WSJ India Real Time |title=WikiLeaks: Dow Monitored Bhopal Activists |date=29 February 2012 |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/02/29/wikileaks-dow-monitored-bhopal-activists/|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SambhavnaEntrance.jpg|thumb|right|The entrance to the Sambhavna Trust Clinic.]]
[[File:Bhopal Sambhavna Trust 05 (14037592191).jpg|thumb|right|Sambhavna Trust]]
The '''Sambhavna Trust Clinic''', or '''Bhopal People's Health and Documentation Clinic''', is a charitable trust run by a group of doctors, scientists, writers and social workers who have been involved with various aspects of the Union Carbide disaster ([[Bhopal disaster]]) in Bhopal, India, ever since its occurrence in December 1984.

The Clinic in Bhopal, run by the Sambhavna Trust and initiated by [[Satinath Sarangi]], opened its doors on 2 September 1996 as an independent, community based, non governmental medical initiative concerned with the long-term welfare of the survivors. It offers an innovative blend of modern and traditional therapies free of cost to the disaster affected victims.

==Meaning of Sambhavna==

Taken from a poster found at the Clinic's entrance: "Sambhavna is a Hindi word that literally means possibilities. If read as 'Sama' (equal) + 'Bhavna' (feelings), it means equal feelings or passion. [In this sense], we are characterizing both meanings of creating possibilities for the survivors of the world's worst industrial disaster."

==Location==

The Sambhavna Clinic is located in the middle of communities that were most severely affected by the Bhopal Disaster as it is 400 meters south of the former Union Carbide plant. The Clinic is also in proximity to communities affected by contamination of the ground water through chemical wastes. Built on a 2-acre plot, along with the complex, the Clinic contains an herbal garden for Aryuvedic Care. With the principles of environmental sustainability, the facilities incorporate rain water harvesting, solar panels for energy, waste water recycling, non-toxic construction material, and other eco-sensitive features.

==Patient profile==

Patients with a history of gas exposure from the disaster and those who have proved exposure to contaminated ground water are eligible for treatment at the Clinic free of charge. In addition, children born to gas affected parents before December 1986 are also registered for care at the Clinic since research conducted at Sambhavna has shown these children also exhibit symptoms of exposure related health problems. 
As of 2006, the Sambhavna Trust Clinic remains the only institution to provide free health care to gas affected victims. Furthermore, the Clinic is the only health care provider in Bhopal to have a special classification for those who are suffering from ongoing contamination of the ground water and provide care to these persons at no cost as well.

==Allopathic care==

Sambhavna's allopathic care team consists of general physicians, a pediatrician, a gynecologist, and a consultant in pathology. Their work is supported by an in-house pathology laboratory with facilities for biochemical, endocrinological, cytological, and microbiological investigation and diagnosis.

Careful records are kept of each patient's ailments, treatment, and outcome in detail for an investigatory database to establish the efficacy of different treatment protocols. These records are stored both in paper and pen format and an in-house electronic health record system on over 15 networked computers; this system is developed, programmed, and maintained by staff within the Sambhavna Trust Clinic.

==Ayurveda care==

In conjunction with allopathic treatment, the Sambhavna Clinic provides [[Ayurveda]] care: a Hindu system of traditional medicine native to India. Two Ayurveda physicians and two [[Panchakarma]] therapists provide treatment through herbal medicines and through procedures of detoxification such as medicated oil massage, steam bath, medicinal oil stream, and medicinal enema.

===Herbal medicine growth and production===

[[File:SambhavnaGarden.jpg|thumb|right|The lower area of the sloping herbal garden found at Sambhavna.]]More than 150 species of medicinal plants are grown on a 1-acre garden next to the Clinic building. Instead of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, Sambhavna utilizes [[vermicompost]] and bio pesticides for cultivation. More than eighty different kinds of Ayurvedic powders, oils, [[decoction]], and pills are manufactured at the medicine making unit in Sambhavna using tools such as a pulverizer, pill press, and granulator. Significant features of the Ayurvedic health care at Sambhavna include predominant use of herbal drugs over mineral preparations ([[Rasa Shastra]]) and use of modern investigative facilities and techniques for objective assessment of efficacy.

===Yoga===

[[Yoga]] therapy has been found to be particularly useful for treatment of common gas exposure related health problems including breathlessness, backache, joint pains, menstrual irregularities, anxiety, and insomnia. Some of the research efforts at Sambhavna focus on demonstrating the efficacy of yoga therapy in management of gas exposure symptoms. Four objective studies have been conducted on the positive effects of yoga therapy within the patient population at the Clinic.

==Community outreach==

Sambhavna community health workers fulfill many roles in the surrounding gas affected and water contaminated areas of Bhopal. First, the community health workers identify over a thousand patients in need of follow-up care at the Clinic each month and continue to visit these patients to monitor their health and adherence to treatment protocols.
 
Furthermore, they educate communities about common health issues and their treatments and preventions, run comprehensive TB, malaria, anemia control programs, and also organize community based screenings for cervical cancer. In addition, the health workers also collect data on various health markers in the communities they serve for research and health monitoring purposes (see Documentation and Research).
 
The community health workers also have formed voluntary health committees in different neighborhoods around Bhopal. To run these committees, the health workers have inspired, trained, and equipped health volunteers from each community to carry out some biochemical investigations of blood and urine and also prepare slides for examination for the malaria parasite. Starting in 2008, the health workers began to train people to grow and use various medicinal plants in their own neighborhoods. Six small but flourishing herbal gardens have been established in two communities.

==Documentation and research==

Sambhavna maintains what is probably the most comprehensive collection of original source material related to the Bhopal disaster. The Clinic's library materials include newspaper clippings from December 1984 onwards, medical and scientific research papers, legal transcripts, government publications, corporate documents, pamphlets and posters from local and international campaigns, as well as books on a variety of health related subjects. The library is frequently used by researchers, journalists, activists, survivors, and Sambhavna staff.

===Research===

Research on the health consequences of exposure to toxic gases was terminated in 1994 by the Indian Council of Medical Research, and much of their findings remain unpublished to date. With limited staff and financial resources, Sambhavna has made significant contributions to the understanding of long-term health consequences of the disaster and the medical interventions which are effective in ameliorating these problems.

Over 8000 families affected by the gas disaster and control families matched for socio-economic status are currently used to establish cohorts for further investigation of specific health problems. Over the course of the conducted research at Sambhavna, several studies have been published in national and international journals.

===Clinical data===

Since 1996, Sambhavna has registered over 23,000 chronically ill patients from affected communities. Data collected from the field and patient record system is electronically catalogued daily, providing important information to guide future research and provide better care to survivors. Currently, Sambhavna has a networked system of informed consent, registration, and follow-up with continual updates of clinical data.

==Organization and funding==
 
The Sambhavna Clinic is run by an 8-member board of trustees composed of scientists, doctors, editors, and activists who for many years have been involved with medical and other aspects of the disaster. A steering committee, elected by the staff, and two coordinators, look after the day-to-day running of the Clinic. Decision making, evaluation, planning, and review of clinic activities are based on equality, full participation, and consensus at the weekly staff meetings.
 
Sambhavna does not accept money from corporations, governments, or large funding agencies. All funds required to run the Sambhavna Trust Clinic come from individual donations and from the royalties of the book "It Was [[Five Past Midnight in Bhopal]]", by Dominique Lapierre and Javier Moro. A large portion of Sambhavna's funds come from over 15000 individuals in the UK who respond to advertisements placed by the Bhopal Medical Appeal in British newspapers. Contributions are from a variety of people from different backgrounds and socioeconomic levels. For example, the herbal medicine making facilities was built with funds donated by litter pickers at a music festival in the UK. Accounts of the Sambhavna Trust are audited annually and are open to public scrutiny.

==Volunteering==

[[File:SambhavnaDormitories.jpg|thumb|right|One of the dormitories for volunteers at the Sambhavna Trust Clinic.]]Each year, more than two dozen volunteers from India and abroad extend services to Sambhavna during their stay, ranging from one week to two months. Volunteers have come from Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, UK, USA, and other countries. These volunteers have offered a variety of services in their respective fields and applied their skills in medical work, social work, writing, research, gardening, photography, information systems, and more.

==No More Bhopal==

Taken from a pamphlet at the Sambhavna Clinic, the "No More Bhopal" effort is described as follows:
 
"Through its involvement with the gas affected communities and with the global community, Sambhavna is working to stop the medical disaster in Bhopal and to prevent such tragedies from happening again. We organize health camps and workshops in the communities. We work with survivors' organizations fighting for better healthcare, and build links with doctors and researchers in Bhopal and all over the world. So far, we have organized three local, one national, and two international conferences in Bhopal and participated in several."

The '''International Medical Commission on Bhopal''' ('''IMCB''') was established in 1993 to organise medical responses to the 1984 [[Bhopal disaster]] (India).

==Background==
The immediate scientific and medical response to the 1984 [[Bhopal disaster]] constituted an extraordinary pulling together of hospitals, medical personnel and social services in the area. Coping with a disaster of this scale was unheard of anywhere in the world, and there was widespread admiration for those who responded, often risking their own lives in the process.

However, when the long term after effects began to appear, it was obvious that the social and legal climate was inadequate since there was little experience in dealing with a major [[environmental disaster]].&lt;ref name=pmid12412856&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Dhara VR |title=What ails the Bhopal disaster investigations? (And is there a cure?) |journal=International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=371–9 |year=2002 |pmid=12412856 |doi=10.1179/107735202800338605}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific and medical personnel needed access to accident-related and [[toxicology|toxicologic]] information to understand the causes and potential consequences of the disaster. [[Union Carbide]], the primary repository of this information, faced with lawsuits and the prospect of bankruptcy, closed down its channels of communication. On the other hand, the extreme sensitivities of the local and national government bodies towards all aspects of the disaster, coupled with the lack of expertise and funds, resulted in an inadequate response on India’s part to meet the urgent health care and social recovery needs of the community.  Whereas local health professionals and the interested scientific community abroad expected a flood of information from a disaster of this magnitude, only a trickle resulted.

These transnational political and legal ramifications threw a veil of secrecy around the disaster and obstructed the discovery of vital medical and toxicologic information. The medical community was often frustrated in its attempts to understand the links between gas exposure and health and devise appropriate treatment strategies. As an example, ignorance about whether the main poison, [[methyl isocyanate]], could decompose to deadly [[cyanide]] gas, led to years of acrimonious debate on the merits of treating the gas victims for cyanide poisoning.&lt;ref name=pmid12412856/&gt;

Recognising the dire need of the gas victims, the [[Permanent Peoples' Tribunal]] met in 1992 and recommended that an international medical commission provide an in-depth independent assessment of the situation in Bhopal. In 1993, the Bhopal Group for Information and Action (BGIA) made a proposal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhopal.bard.edu/resources/documents/ProposalforIMCB_1993.pdf Proposal from BGIA, July 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; The International Medical Commission on Bhopal (IMCB) was thus constituted with 14 professionals from 12 countries who were chosen on the basis of their medical expertise and experience in [[environmental health]], toxicology, [[neurology]], [[immunology]], [[respiratory medicine]] and [[family medicine]]. Drs. [[Rosalie Bertell]] and Gianni Tognoni served as the co-chairpersons of the IMCB. At the request of Carbide gas victim organisations, the IMCB conducted a humanitarian visit to India in January 1994 to contribute in any way possible to the relief of the victims and to suggest ways to in which such catastrophic accidents could be prevented in the future or their effects mitigated. During their stay, the IMCB met with government officials, various disaster experts, hospitals, research teams, local private physicians, biochemists, botanists, various survivor groups, [[environmentalism|environmental activists]] and [[veterinarian]]s.

==Goals==
The '''main goals''' of the IMCB were:

# Betterment of the lives of the victims with rational diagnostic methods and treatment
# Clarification of the place and form of international medical assistance and documentation after a catastrophic accident
# Recommending legislation to protect humans from military and industrial pollution
# Mobilisation of international assistance in response to the request of survivors rather than waiting for government invitation.
# Provide guidelines for planning health research on the impact of major accidents
# Establishment of a precedent for international protection for medical research against interference from conflicted corporations or governments
# Legitimisation of the voices of survivor organisations and their participation in relevant decisions
# Promoting ethical and scientific standards for information collection and communication to victims
# Coordination of medical, research, and legal information to assist victims in claims
# Alerting the Government of India to the need for full disclosure of potential hazards and environmental impact studies prior to allowing any hazardous industry to set up in India

The commissioners divided their work in various groups:
* Community &amp; clinical studies: survey of the population followed by clinical testing of selected groups
* Assessment of availability and quality of medical care, including level of medical resources available.
* Examination of the adequacy and equity of laws and regulations relating to claims and the distribution of compensation;
* Evaluation of drug therapy by examination of prescriptions routinely given to survivors;
* Accident analysis;
* Review of studies and published literature on the disaster.

The IMCB committed itself to a) provide a full report of its findings and recommendations to the Governments of India and [[Madhya Pradesh]], victims’ organisations, and all other interested parties; b) stand ready to assist the government of India and medical colleagues to implement the recommendations of the commission; c) enlist the National Advisory Committee to follow up the initiatives of the commission; d) recommend research studies to be undertaken in India on the long-term effects of the gas exposure, and e) assure the wide circulation of its experience and findings in the professional literature.

==Findings==

===Union Carbide===
The IMCB publicly condemned Union Carbide and reiterated the company's full liability not only for responsibility in causing the deadly gas leak, but also for the confounding role of its behaviour with respect to pre-accident preventive and exposure mitigating efforts, and the timely and effective application of the appropriate medical measures at the time of the accident. This included the lack of transparency about the composition of the gases released, resulting in the absence of rational methods of care and planning resulting in loss of sight and in some cases life, and creation of suspicion and conflict among professionals and the population.  There was also a lack of emergency preparation which would have made the public and professionals aware of the potential toxins inside the plant and how to respond to an accident.

===Indian government===
The government of India also was faulted since no clear guidelines were laid down to determine compensation to the victims resulting in undue delays and aggravation of their health status and/or economic survival. The secrecy surrounding the health studies undertaken by the [[Indian Council of Medical Research]] (ICMR) may initially have been instituted to protect the litigation process, but in reality made the rational medical treatment and establishment of claims almost impossible. In hindsight, it is clear that the secrecy served no purpose whatsoever and has resulted in non-publication of the information.  Moreover, because of the secrecy about the accident itself and the chemicals released, it was difficult for the survivors to document their claims. The Commission also noted an excessive fear among government personnel of bogus claims.

In fulfilling its commitment, results of the community studies conducted by the IMCB have been communicated to the affected population in the form of public meetings, which provided a forum for the victims to ask questions and provide comments.&lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ4Qbx8czfc&gt; The studies have also been published in various national and international journals so that the scientific community has access to this information.

==Recommendations of the IMCB==
The IMCB made the following recommendations:
#Reorganisation of the health system to establish a network of community-based [[primary care]] clinics;
#The gas-related disease categories need to be broadened to include [[central nervous system]] and [[psychological]] (PTD) injury;
#A conference to determine [[best practice]] [[rehabilitation medicine]], including both Western and Indian expertise, must be undertaken to develop rational treatments and [[prescription drug]]s for survivors.
#Health data collected by the ICMR should be communicated to the population and submitted for publication in professional journals.
#Gas victims to have the right of access to their medical records;
#Victim organisations should be adequately represented in the national and state commissions dealing with the disaster;
#Criteria for compensation should include medical, economic and social damage to the victims
#Allocation of resources for economic and social rehabilitation of people and their communities should be made.
#Thorough examination of the impact of the toxic waste buried on the Union Carbide site and its potential for further damage to public health needs to be researched.

===Long-term effects===
It is now well known that persistent and chronic gas-related health effects are present in the Bhopal population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Dhara VR, Dhara R |title=The Union Carbide disaster in Bhopal: a review of health effects |journal=Archives of Environmental Health |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=391–404 |year=2002 |pmid=12641179 |url=http://webdrive.service.emory.edu/users/vdhara/www.BhopalPublications/Health%20Effects%20&amp;%20Epidemiology/Health%20Effects%20Review%20articles/Health%20Effects%20Review%20AEH.pdf |doi=10.1080/00039890209601427}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Cullinan P, Acquilla SD, Dhara VR.

R }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a lack of systematic collection of relevant information in these reproductive effects, and also with respect to cancer development or other chronic illnesses as [[sequelae]] of the gas exposure.

Recent investigations have shown that local well water has become contaminated by the improper storage of a large amount of hazardous waste in the facility, or on its grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Labunska |first1=I. |last2=Stephenson |first2=A. |last3=Brigden |first3=K. |last4=Stringer |first4=R. |last5=Santillo |first5=D. |last6=Johnston |first6=P.

As of 2007, the prospects for learning the sequelae of this disaster do not appear to be bright. What is sorely needed is an independent body to coordinate the health care, research, rehabilitation of gas victims, and care for potential effects in their offspring. Instead of the non-directive symptomatic medical treatment that currently exists, clear guidelines and criteria need to be formulated for specific medical conditions such as damage to [[bronchial tubes]], [[sleep apnea]], neuron destruction, etc. Such an effort could be implemented through India's existing health care pyramid. Community-level health units should be developed to serve a maximum of 5000 people each.  Local hospitals with multiple departments can be used to provide secondary care. A specialised medical centre dedicated to treatment and research of the more serious problems arising from the gas leak should be established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jlp.2005.06.008 |url=http://webdrive.service.emory.edu/users/vdhara/www.BhopalPublications/Health%20Effects%20&amp;%20Epidemiology/Surveys/Aftermath%20of%20Bhopal%20&amp;%20Intl%20Med%20Comm%20investigation.pdf |title=Aftermath of the world's worst chemical disasterBhopal, December 1984 |year=2005 |last1=Acquilla |first1=S |last2=Bertell |first2=R |last3=Dhara |first3=V |last4=Tognoni |first4=G |journal=Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries |volume=18|issue=4–6 |pages=268–273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IMCB believes it is a mistake to simply increase the number of hospital beds in Bhopal. The community has need for more neighbourhood clinics, non-drug respiratory therapy, clean air and water, and sheltered workshops, not for more hospital beds.

===Need for long-term monitoring===
The IMCB has recommended that long-term monitoring of the community for illness and response to treatment be done for several decades. This would include the study of exposed and unexposed areas to observe patterns of illness and death as well as to detect the occurrence of related chronic diseases and the appearance of new diseases. Such an approach needs to be one in which the health professionals involve the community of gas victims as active partners in investigation, provide them with feedback on community health, ensure that their health risks are properly communicated, and thereby enabling an increase in their consciousness, autonomy and self-determination.

Dhara and Acquilla critiqued aspects of post-disaster epidemiology which served as obstacles to the conduct of scientific and valid epidemiological investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dhara VR, Acquilla S | year = 2013 | title = Regarding distance of residence in 1984 may be used as exposure surrogate for the Bhopal disaster - further observations on post-disaster epidemiology | url = | journal = Indian J Med Res | volume = 138 | issue = | pages = 270–272 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

#The original cohort of registered by the Indian Council of Medical research (ICMR) was chosen on the basis of health effects rather than any true measure of gas exposure. Instead, the cohort of 96,000 was selected based on severe, moderate, and mildly affected areas based on death rates.  Prior versions of the technical report characterised the area as ‘affected’ but later versions contained confusing and contradictory terms such as ‘exposed and affected’, ‘exposed but unaffected’ and the term ‘affected’ was used interchangeably with ‘exposed’. In epidemiological studies, it is well known that not all subjects in an exposed area are affected. As early as 1987, a dispersion model was available which delineated the exposed areas but was never used. 
#The selected cohort ratio was heavily skewed toward the severely affected area (75%) and such a selection would have introduced bias in the results and an incomplete understanding of the health effects in the population. The non-random cluster of deaths sample selection approach instead of randomised selection using a sampling frame had the potential for interviewer bias due to prior knowledge of potential health effects. Persons migrating out were excluded rather than treated as [[lost to follow-up]] thereby shrinking the sample size available for analysis.
#Operational problems with such a large cohort included inadequate staffing and equipment - only 20 research assistants were available for monitoring the 96,000 person cohortiv and we estimate that one research assistants would have the herculean task of interviewing 40 families daily.
#The six monthly morbidity and mortality prevalence data has not been consistently published since the cohort was formed. There may be some internal reports but these are not available to the wider scientific community or even the general public. Timely publication of epidemiological data is vital to understanding the spectrum of gas-related disease and provision of health services. ICMR’s first comprehensive reports appeared more than twenty years after the disaster, thus rendering them merely an academic exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62562-3 |title=Bhopal study represents "missed opportunity" |journal=The Lancet |volume=382 |issue=9908 |pages=1870 |year=2013 |last1=Sharma |first1=Dinesh C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bhopal medical community was faced with 1) the urgent health care needs of the affected community, 2) the non-availability of toxicological and accident-related information, 3) the extreme sensitivity of local and national government bodies toward all aspects of the disaster, 4) lack of expertise, and 5) the lack of funds available to independent researchers to conduct investigations. Faced with lawsuits and the prospect of bankruptcy, Union Carbide’s efforts to keep open channels of communication were highly inadequate to address these issues and were considered by many to be a major human rights violation. In addition, the transnational political and legal ramifications served to throw a veil of secrecy around the disaster, thus impeding the discovery of essential pieces of information. Medical, toxicological, and accident-analysis data were not made public, thereby frustrating the efforts of the medical community to understand the linkage between exposures and health effects and devise appropriate treatment strategies. As an example, the lack of information about whether MIC could thermally decompose to hydrocyanic acid led to years of contentious debate on the merits of treating the gas victims for cyanide poisoning and an unfortunate violation of patient confidentiality.

Koplan et al. indicated that post-disaster epidemiologic studies should accurately estimate exposure to enable correct dose-response relationship modeling.  These data are needed for a) identifying ill and exposed persons, b) determining long-term effects, and c) linking exposure and effects for use in litigation and to determine compensation. In the absence of the above modeling, studies on Bhopal victims will suffer from the limitation that the link between exposure and health effects cannot be easily made.

===Working with other agencies===
Recognising that Bhopal is a tragic model of an industrial epidemic, members of IMCB have expressed willingness to organise international teams when requested, to provide technical assistance and evaluation of other environmental disasters. Rather than the provision of emergency relief functions, for which there are other organisations such as Medecins sans Frontieres and the Red Cross/Red Crescent, the IMCB envisioned three levels:

# response to communities who appeal on the basis of chronic disability due to a disaster, after its acute phase is over;
# represent victims at the international level, for example, the World Health Agency, to recommend legislative changes required to implement the International Bill of Rights relevant to health and safety, and
# working to define the appropriate public health investigations to serve the needs of the injured community rather than use the victim community to merely serve the needs of science.

The International Bill of Rights includes: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, proclaimed on 10 Dec 1948; The International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (1976), and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1976.

The steps to be taken to achieve the full realisation of this right shall include:
*provision for the reduction of infant deaths and for healthy development of the child;
*improvement of all aspects of environmental and industrial hygiene;
*prevention, treatment, and control of epidemic, endemic, occupational and other diseases;
*creation of conditions which would assure to all people medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness,
*assuring the victims a living, work and social environment conducive to healing of its injuries.

To protect these rights, an international body, free of industry and government pressures, and competent to advise on health and safety standards, is required to be able to mediate just and equitable resolution and compensation of damage in the case of unanticipated disasters.

'''Satinath (Sathyu) Sarangi''' was born in [[Chakradharpur]], [[Jharkhand]], India, on 25 September 1954. Since 1984 he is living in [[Bhopal]]. He has been involved with the multiple activities run by a network of local, national and international groups, pursuing health and economic needs, fighting legal claims, providing medical support and reminding the world that the [[Bhopal disaster]] of 1984 happened. Sarangi is the founder of several activist organisations. He is also the founder and manager of [[Sambhavna Trust]].

==Studies==
Educational Qualification: Master of technology (M Tech) (Metallurgical Engineering), [[Indian Institute of Technology (Banaras Hindu University), Varanasi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itbhuglobal.org/chronicle/archives/2010/12/satinath_sarang.php&lt;/ref&gt; He enrolled for PhD in 1980, but dropped out in 1984.&lt;ref name=biography&gt;[http://www.itbhuglobal.org/chronicle/Biography%20of%20Sathyu%20Sarangi.pdf Biography of Sathyu Sarangi]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=honorary&gt;[http://www.qmu.ac.uk/the_university/sathyusarangi.htm Oration - Sathyu Sarangi] [[Queen Margaret University]], Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism before 1984==
Sarangi's work as a campaigner started early as he became involved in various campaigns including indigenous people’s struggle for self-determination in Bihar and the Society of Social Workers, students involved in organising low caste agricultural workers.&lt;ref name=biography /&gt;&lt;ref name=honorary /&gt;

==Activism in Bhopal==
Sarangi arrived in Bhopal the day after the [[Bhopal disaster]], the gas release the night of 2–3 December 1984. He immediately got engaged in issues on health care and the rights of the victims. Thus, he was one of those exposed to the violence of police and authorities. When other activists left Bhopal, he stayed on. Being well educated, he supported the victims and their organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0FqO8XKy9NRZDNzTkZQeVJQbE0/edit?pli=1 Eckerman I. The Bhopal Saga - causes and consequences of the world's largest industrial disaster] Universities Press (India) Private Ltd, Hyderabad 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in December 1984, he was a founder member of Zahareeli Gas Kand Sangharsh Morcha (Poisonous Gas Episode Struggle Front), an organization of survivors of the [[Union Carbide India Limited|Union Carbide]] disaster in Bhopal [[Bhopal disaster]]. In 1986, he founded the Bhopal Group for Information and Action (BGIA). In 1989, he made a campaign tour to USA, UK, Ireland and The Netherlands.&lt;ref name="biography" /&gt;&lt;ref name=honorary /&gt;

He was a member of the organizing committee for Bhopal session of the [[Permanent Peoples' Tribunal]] on Industrial and Environmental Hazards and Human Rights in 1992, and the National Organizing Secretary for the [[International Medical Commission on Bhopal]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="biography" /&gt;&lt;ref name=honorary /&gt;

In 1996, he finally could fulfil his dream of providing free and proper health care for the gas victims. That year, the [[Sambhavna Trust]] (or Bhopal People's Health and Documentation Clinic) was inaugurated. At the 20th anniversary in 2004, he presented the new buildings and the garden to be. Sambhavna clinic also undertakes community health work. It is the only organisation currently researching the long-term effects of the Bhopal gas exposure.

Other important activities were the marches to Delhi and hungerstrikes in 2006 and 2008. In 2009 he participated in the Bhopal Europe Bus Tour. In his work, he interacts closely with survivors’ associations.

'''''Bhopal Express''''' ({{lang-hi|भोपाल एक्सप्रेस}}) is a [[Bollywood films of 1999|1999]] [[Hindi film]] directed by [[Mahesh Mathai]]. The film stars  [[Kay Kay Menon]], [[Naseeruddin Shah]], [[Nethra Raghuraman]], [[Zeenat Aman]] and [[Vijay Raaz]]. The story was written by the advertising film maker [[Prasoon Pandey]] and his brother [[Piyush Pandey]]. The music was composed by the [[Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy]] trio.

==Plot==
Set against the [[Bhopal Gas Tragedy|gas tragedy in Bhopal]], India, in 1984, this human drama examines the irresponsible methods of large corporations and the effects of their actions on common people. The night of the tragedy, poison gas clouds from the Union Carbide factory enveloped an arc of over 20 square kilometres killing over 8,000 people in its immediate aftermath and causing multi-systemic injuries to over 500,000 residents. Lest the neighbourhood community be "unduly alarmed", the siren in the factory had been switched off, adding to what would become an enduring disaster of immeasurable proportions. Adding insult to injury, researchers find that the future generations of the survivors will continue to suffer through chromosomal damage caused by the leak. The story unravels through the eyes of a newlywed couple and their friends as they try to pick up the pieces in the aftermath of the catastrophe.

Between 1999 and 2009, Bergman headed the human rights organisation Centre for Corporate Accountability and advocated for legal reforms on work-related deaths.&lt;ref name=1999CCA /&gt;&lt;ref name=trustreport /&gt;

==Activism in Bhopal==
[[Gita Sahgal]], who later produced ''War Crimes File'', said she first met Bergman when he was politically active in the relief work after the [[Bhopal disaster]] in India.&lt;ref name=sahgalinterview /&gt; Bergman first traveled from [[Birmingham]], England, to [[Bhopal]] in March 1986 by bicycle as a charity to raise ₤5,000 for the victims of the disaster. While there, he became entangled in a legal dispute over the government's role in relief that ''[[The Guardian]]'' later dubbed "The Bergman Affair".&lt;ref name=affair /&gt; Other organizations providing relief to the victims of the Bhopal disaster said they were harassed or prevented from being effective because of government intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael |last=Hamlyn |title=Bhopal gas tragedy claims more victims two years on: Aftermath of Indian chemical plant disaster |newspaper=The Times (London) |date=3 December 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1986, when Bergman was 21 years old, he was held in custody in violation of India's [[The Foreigners Act, 1946|Foreigners Act]] and [[National Security Act (India)|National Security Act]] and was accused of working for [[Union Carbide]].&lt;ref name=thetimesplot /&gt;&lt;ref name=highcourt /&gt; Around the time of his detention, Bergman was on a [[hunger strike]] and also suffering from [[hepatitis]], and although he requested the court allow him to travel for treatment his request was denied, as was his father's intervention on behalf of his son's health.&lt;ref name=thetimesplot /&gt;&lt;ref name=guardianplot&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul |last=Hoyland |title=India holds British aid worker: Arrest of David Bergman under official secrets act |newspaper=The Guardian (UK) |date=9 September 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=upiplot&gt;{{cite news|first=Mazhar |last=Ullah |title=Briton faces trial in Bhopal leak |publisher=United Press International |date=22 September 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=plot /&gt; He denied the charges as a form of harassment and challenged the lower courts decision.&lt;ref name=highcourt /&gt;&lt;ref name=dismissed /&gt; His case was heard before the Supreme Court,&lt;ref name=highcourt&gt;{{cite news|author=Reuters |title=Court to Hear Man's Plea on Bhopal |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=30 October 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the high court decided in his favour and also allowed for his continued stay in India to take part in the relief efforts.&lt;ref name=affair&gt;{{cite news|title=Bhopal Briton wins visa ruling: David Bergman affair |newspaper=The Guardian (UK) |date=31 October 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Supreme Court intervened again and forced the lower court to dismiss the charges.&lt;ref name=dismissed&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris |last=Steyn |title=Bhopal Briton returns: David Bergman |newspaper=The Times (London) |date=2 January 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergman later spoke to the media for the Bhopal Action Group, London, and argued against the sabotage theory advocated by Union Carbide and in favour of design flaws as the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Roger |last=Milne |date=19 May 1988 |title='Act of Sabotage' killed thousands at Bhopal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBbmVGaFBpAC&amp;pg=PA28 |magazine=New Scientist |page=28 |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India: Challenges Union Carbide's Bid for Personal Settlements |publisher=Inter Press Service |date=17 June 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also published an article in a law journal about these competing views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=David |last=Bergman |title=The sabotage theory and the legal strategy of Union Carbide |publisher=New Law Journal |volume=138 |date=17 June 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Animal's People''''' is a novel by [[Indra Sinha]]. It was shortlisted for the 2007 [[Man Booker Prize]] and is the Winner of the 2008 [[Commonwealth Writers' Prize]]: Best Book From Europe &amp; South Asia. Sinha's narrator is a 19-year-old orphan of Khaufpur, born a few days before the [[1984 Bhopal disaster]], whose spine has become so twisted that he must walk on all fours. Ever since he can remember, he has gone on all fours. Known to every-one simply as Animal, he rejects sympathy, spouts profanity and obsesses about sex. He lives with a crazy old French nun called Ma Franci, and his dog Jara. Also, he falls in love with a local musician's daughter, Nisha.

The story was recorded in Hindi on a series of tapes by Animal himself and it has been translated to English as well.
The author uses Animal's odd mixture of [[Hindi]], [[French language|French]] and Indianised English such as "kampani" (company), "jarnalis" (journalist) and "jamisponding" (spying, like [[James Bond]]).

== Title ==

The title ''Animal’s People'' offers interesting insight into the novel, as it gives us a view of the way the people of Khaufpur identified themselves. The chorus of the children copying Elli, after stating she doesn’t understand Animal's People, shows this unification of the people of Khaufpur. "We can hear the chorus of small voices gradually falling behind, ‘Hey Animal’s People!’"&lt;ref&gt;Sinha, Indra. ''Animal's People''. Great Britain: Simon &amp; Schuster (2007) {{ISBN|978-0-7432-5920-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unification of people usually takes place during a disaster, which occurs during and after the crisis in Khaufpur. The title of the novel is used to help identify this unification of people and also to foreshadow the difficulty Elli will face when trying to open the clinic. Elli will have to try to break down the tough barriers which exist in Khaufpur, to help the people move past what they fear the most, change. The comfort they seek is always being able to blame the kampani for what happened to them, and assuming every outsider is there because the kampani sent them. The relation to the title is that Animal is a prime example of the hatred, with his foul mouth and negative attitude towards everything.

The title "Animal’s People" also refers to the difference in behaviors and attitudes between the citizens of Kaufpur and the American doctor, Elli. This becomes apparent on page 183 when Elli is frustrated about everyone's attitude toward her clinic, and yells "HEY ANIMAL’S PEOPLE! I DON’T [...] UNDERSTAND YOU!" She came to Kaufpur with only a mere idea of how the people had suffered. She knew that people were ill and her duty would be to nourish them back to health, but that was the extent of her connection to them. Due to her more fortunate circumstances, she could never fully grasp the trauma and the aftermath of the gas leak or the chronic poverty which plagued the city. Furthermore, she was oblivious to the reasons why the citizens were so untrustworthy toward outsiders. Without experiencing it for herself, Elli the doctress was an outcast among the rest of the city of Kaufpur—Animal's People.

== Major characters ==

;Animal
Animal is the protagonist of this story. He is a victim of a chemical factory explosion caused by Kampani and is depicted as a boy with a twisted spine that roams around Khaufpur on both of his hands and feet like a dog. He constantly denies his humanity and claims that he is an animal. After this factory incident, Animal is put in an orphanage and taken care of by Ma Franci. He has no recollection of his parents. Animal openly displays his hatred toward humans yet there is a side of him that yearns to be a human being. Therefore, when an American doctor comes to Khaufpur, he regains his lost hope of being able to stand on his own two feet and dreams for that day to come. Although Animal initially loathes his inability to walk on two feet, in the end, he realizes that being a four-foot is better off for him. By being a four-foot, Animal avoids being one of the millions of upright humans and instead becomes the one and only Animal.

;Somraj
Pandit Somraj Tryambak Punekar is Nisha's father and a music teacher. He is described as tall, with a long and pointy nose, and long fingers. He also has a stoic nature, being called solemn and private by Animal. The most important fact about Somraj is that he used to be a famous singer, known throughout India, who was referred to as the Voice of Khaufpur. However the night of the accident he lost his wife and baby son, in addition to his lungs being damaged by the chemicals. He no longer sings, and if he tries he has coughing fits.

;Ma Françi
Ma Françi is a nun from France who worked in the orphanage where Animal grew up. She acts as Animal's mother figure and can be described as kind, although mildly senile. Her affliction from the accident is her loss of understanding Hindi and English. She believes that everyone else is speaking gibberish and is unable to understand that they are using another language, not just making random sounds. She also sees prophetic angels as a result of her madness. However, she still does her duties of going from house to house, helping the sick and injured as best she can.

;Zafar
Zafar is Nisha's boyfriend. He is described as a man in his late thirties, tall, good-looking, thin with a jutting beard, curly black hair and glasses which makes him appear wise. Zafar is an outsider who is so appalled by the Kampani actions that he moves to Khaufpur to advocate on their behalf. He sacrifices everything in his life, including his studies as a scholar for the poor and sick. He is a saint and hero to the citizens of Khaufpur.

;Farouq
Farouq is Animal's friend and nemesis. Farouq's family came to Khaufpur from Yar-yilaqis. His intelligence is that of a criminal in a gang, like his two brothers, or a mechanic. He is Muslim, a movie expert, and Zafar's number two man.

;Nisha
Daughter of Somraj, girlfriend of Zafar, friend of Animal. Nisha sees Animal in the gutter and introduces him to Zafar. She is the object of his affection, yet sees him as a friend only.

;Elli
American doctor who comes to Khaupfur. She is frequently described as wearing blue jeans and is an object of lust for Animal and others in the town. Acting out of philanthropy, she struggles to find acceptance.

==Major themes==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}

===Westernization===
Westernization plays a key role throughout the novel: setting up key relations between characters, showing Sinha's view on western influence, and giving a more accurate depiction of "distant sufferers." This book is about a chemical disaster—caused by an American company—on Indian soil. Furthering this point Sinha shows a complete refusal by the same company to accept any repercussions for their actions. The various examples of apprehension towards outsiders (the journalist (Jarnaliss), the leaders of the Company (Kampani), and Elli the doctress) give insight into preexisting blame-based relationships. These outsiders, associated with the company that neglected responsibility for making the people ill, are seen as tools to help mask and minimize the harm to Khaufpur. Western materialism is objectified through Animal's eyes, with images like the Coca-Cola sign that is so commercialized that it transcends language barriers. Sinha alters facts from the real [[Bhopal disaster]] including the name of the city, the company responsible, and names of individuals involved in the relief effort. This shows how he wished to make this story applicable to all western caused debacles.

===Identity===
At the conclusion of ''Animal’s People'', Animal finally accepts who he is—Animal. We see this concept of self-acceptance as a major theme in this novel, as we see Animal transform through the sharing of his story. Throughout the novel, Animal struggles internally with who he is, especially with his appearance as an animal rather than a human. However, after coming to terms with what has happened and the suffering he experienced as a consequence, Animal accepts who that has allowed him to become—a person whose identity doesn’t come from the events of the Kampani disaster, but rather a person whose identity comes from personal experiences and the people who surround him in his life. We know Animal has truly come to accept his new identity when he decisively says, "Stay four-foot, I’m the one and only Animal."

===Love===
Love is seen in different forms throughout the novel. Perhaps the simplest form of love presented is the mother-son relationship between Animal and Ma Françi. While Animal spends much of his day away from his senile "mother," he always makes a point to check in, especially when chaos breaks out in Khaufpur. Animal's desire for physical love is very apparent starting from the beginning of the novel. Animal speaks using vulgar language and crude humor and is often very blunt in what he wants, especially in front of the women he desires. Animal's physical love for Nisha can be recognized early in the novel, particularly when he expresses extreme jealously towards her boyfriend, Zafar. As the novel progresses, Animal's love for Nisha noticeably changes into a more compassionate type of love – a love that allows the reader to understand that Animal has come to consider Nisha as family.

==Narrative structure==

The novel is told through Animal's tape recordings. The Kakadu Jarnalis insists Animal tell his story. The tapes are recorded in Hindi by Animal and then translated into English by the journalist. Like with previous foreign journalists, Animal thinks that his story will be entangled with everyone else's in Khaufpur; the stories of all survivors will be meshed together to form one tragic tale. To ensure this won’t happen, Animal agrees to tell his story if only it will be told exactly how it is presented through his tapes.

In Animal's second tape, he dwells on the audience and directly addresses the audience. In a letter to Animal, Jarnalis states "Animal, you must imagine that you are talking to just one person. Slowly that person will come to seem real to you. Imagine them to be a friend. You must trust them and open your heart to them, that person will not judge you badly whatever you say." Animal then talks to the reader and says "You are reading my words, you are that person. I’ve no name for you so I will call you Eyes."

Indra Sinha begins ''Animal’s People'' with the editor's note: "This story was recorded in Hindi on a series of tapes by a nineteen-year-old boy in the Indian city of Khaufpur. True to the agreement between the boy and the journalist who befriended him, the story is told entirely in the boy’s words as recorded on the tapes." Although this premise is entirely fictional, Sinha wanted to convey the story in a way that gave authority and a singular voice to the real, but little known aftermath of a gas leak in India that is considered the world's worst industrial disaster, the Bhopali disaster. The "recorded tapes" are arranged in a largely linear manner that is interrupted with flashbacks that skip between the past and present. They impart the story gradually, developing the setting and characters of Animal's past while simultaneously incorporating ongoing events. Animal tells his story in the past-tense, as he is repeating experiences to Jarnalis via the tapes. The first and second tapes introduce Animal as the narrator and establish the audience as nothing more than disembodied "eyes." In the middle of the second tape, Animal jumps back to when he was six years old and the pains of his apparent morph from "human to animal" that occurred as his spine twisted to the point where he had to walk on all fours. He then quickly fast-forwards in tape three to the meeting of present characters: Nisha and Zafar, then interjects a narration that describes the current appearance of the Kampani's factory. The story continues in this flitting manner to uncover the full depth of the situation through Animal's unexpectedly fierce and spirited narration, giving an unconventional take on the idea of "distant sufferers."

==Style==

''Animal’s People'' is primarily a first-person monologue in which the narrator (Animal) details past events of his life and his internal thoughts from that time to an audience whose existence he is aware of. On occasion the novel changes to a third-person narrative where Animal narrates another character's independent experiences, such as Elli's interactions with her ex-husband in Tape Twenty. In both cases, the story, though it occurred in the past, is presented in the present tense. Despite the fact that the novel details past events, Animal is not presented as an omniscient narrator—the reader is never informed beyond Animal himself (the character rather than the narrator) in the context of the story. This, in addition to Sinha's use of present tense to describe past events causes the reader to experience Animal's life (in the form of [[direct speech]]) alongside him while still allowing for commentary from a narrator who has already lived through these experiences (usually in the form of [[indirect speech]]). Thus, the reader is caused to identify more strongly with Animal's own thoughts, emotions, and desires as the story unfolds—something that falls in line with Indra Sinha's past career writing emotionally charged advertisements for charities such as Amnesty International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sofii.org/node/238 |title=Amnesty International UK: press ads that shook a nation |publisher=SOFII |date=2011-06-13 |accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Influence of perspective'''

The story told by Indra Sinha in ''Animal’s People'' is one that is obviously influenced by the Bhopal disaster from 1984, and the way Sinha wants the world to see the disaster. Sinha chose to write the story in a fictionalized setting so he could write “freely”, as opposed to the situation he already knew regarding Bhopal.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;[http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/interview/with/author/indra-sinha Interview with Indra Sinha], BookDepository.co.uk, 9 December 2008. Retrieved 13 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his goal was to instead tell the aftermath of the disaster which he does through the lens of Animal. In Animal, the perspective of Sinha and many others still seeking reparations from the incident are channeled and reflected.

'''Khaufpuri language'''

Indra Sinha's inclusion of words such as ''kampani'' and ''Khaufpur''—"kauf" meaning "terror" in Urdu&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; —challenges readers' competency as linguists. Animal's language (Khaufpuri) requires readers to recognize phonetic similarities to English and etymological cues (e.g. Hindi, French) in order to ascribe meaning to the text. The inclusion of a Khaufpuri Glossary in ''Animal's People'' substantiates the cultural richness of Animal and the Khaufpuri people while successfully reminding the reader of the "otherness" of Animal. Sinha's melding of linguistic traditions enhances the meaning of the text and artistic freedom of the author.

==Historical references==

===Appearance===
''Animal's People'''s description of the Kampani disaster site is accurate to [[Union Carbide]]’s actual abandoned factory. The novel depicts the factory as untouched and overgrown. So many years after the Bhopal Disaster, the Kampani company has not returned to the scene and cleaned up the mess. Animal mentions the steps leading nowhere, and the abandoned tanks —cracked and still containing toxic chemicals. Trees and other vegetation have taken over the area, making it difficult to access and travel within.

Indra Sinha's description is similar to the real factory in Bhopal, India. In 1996, tests were administered on the soil and water testing for toxic chemicals. Results came back positive—water is still being contaminated. Through observation of pictures, tanks are left untouched, stairs leading to nothing substantial, rust covering everything, and trees and wild grass everywhere. Indra Sinha's Kampani in ''Animal’s People'' has many similarities to the Union Carbide factory in Bhopal.&lt;ref name=cloud&gt;Watson, Paul.

===Correspondence===
''Animal's People'' takes place in the town Khaufpur and is based on Bhopal, India. It is the site of one of the world's worst industrial accidents. The first instance of court being brought up in the novel references a trial that is said to take place 18 years after the initial disaster. Zafar tells how the Kampani refuses to recognize the court's decision to proceed with criminal charges against American executives in India. Finally at the end of this first court date, they are able to get the court to review the assets of the Kampani in an effort to bring the people responsible to justice. The court case depicted in the novel is rooted in the reality of the criminal cases surrounding the Bhopal disaster. The Indian Supreme Court was quick to bring criminal charges against the CEO of Union Carbide, Warren Anderson.

Following the disaster, Anderson traveled to India and was immediately placed under house arrest upon arrival. He left the country never to return. As part of a 470 million dollar settlement reached in 1989, the criminal charges in the case were dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhopal.com/~/media/Files/Bhopal/chrono_2012_3.pdf |title=Union Carbide Corporation : Chronology - Updated November 2012 |publisher=Bhopal.com |accessdate=2013-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112133048/http://www.bhopal.com/~/media/Files/Bhopal/chrono_2012_3.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through petitions and protests, activists were able to restore the criminal charges against Anderson and four other Union Carbide employees in 1991.&lt;ref name=cloud/&gt; Despite this decision by Indian courts, warrants being issued, and requests for extradition, the CEO refused to appear in Indian court. Numerous trials were held that Union Carbide officials never acknowledged. In June 2012, a U.S. Court ruled that neither Union Carbide nor their former CEO were liable for any of the charges brought against them.&lt;ref name=cloud/&gt; [[Dow Chemical]], which bought Union Carbide, has repeatedly denied responsibility for the disaster or its repercussions, but in July 2013 Indian courts decided that Dow Chemical is still responsible to survivors of the almost three decades old disaster. It is thought that 100,000 people are still suffering from the 1984 gas leak.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/india-court-decision-requires-dowchemical-respond-bhopal-gas-tragedy-2013-07-23 India: Court Decision Requires Dow Chemical to Respond to Bhopal Gas Tragedy]. Amnesty International. 23 July 2013. Retrieved 10 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outside intervention===

The [[Sambhavna Trust]] is an organization that was founded to bring aid to the victims of the Bhopal Disaster. It set up various clinics throughout the affected area, none of which charged any fees for treatment. Each clinic was allopathic and served as a one-stop spot for treatment.&lt;ref name=clinics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhopal.org/the-clinics/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129073409/http://www.bhopal.org/the-clinics/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-11-29 |title=The Clinics :: The Bhopal Medical Appeal :: Funding free clinics for Bhopal survivors |publisher=Bhopal.org |date=2013-08-13 |accessdate=2013-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Animal’s People'', this was personified through Ellie. She was able to provide medical aid to people who came to her, and also placed focus on their mental health and well-being by befriending all her patients and counseling them on a more personal level so they could finally accept and understand their disorders.

The Sambhavna Trust also emphasized mental health and recovery by providing yoga and massage sessions through its Ayurveda Care department. This type of treatment is native to India and specific to the Hindu culture.&lt;ref name=clinics/&gt; Ellie made sure to medicate the whole person, not just their physical ailments. She befriended Animal and helped him through his internal struggle about the orientation of his body. At the end of the novel, Animal is very accepting of his new form and it is all from Ellie and her unconditional support.

The Sambhavna Trust didn’t come about until 1996, and the gas leak occurred in 1984.&lt;ref name=clinics/&gt; In those 12 years, the victims received care in hospital-based facilities, which were too expensive for a lot of those people. Even though the Indian government eventually decided to give free healthcare to the victims, their children were not covered, even though their health was also compromised. The majority of the outsiders’ focus was going towards either research or compensation and recognition for the survivors, not their health.&lt;ref name=unending&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bridgethanna/files/Unending_Disaster.pdf |title=Bhopal : Unending Disaster, Enduring Resistance |publisher=Scholar.harvard.edu |accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, nobody was sure how to react to the Sambhavna Trust clinics, and whether they were actually there to help.&lt;ref name=unending/&gt; In the book, Ellie was the first one to come in to help the victims. They were very wary of her at first, thinking that she was gathering statistics for Kampani's research, since that is what they were used beforehand. Once her intentions were regarded as pure and earned the people's trust, they were more than willing to receive her help.

==Reception==
According to ''The Bookbag'', Sinha's book was shortlisted for the 2007 Man Booker prize, described in the Independent as an extraordinary achievement and by the Indian Express as a novel so honest it leaves you gasping for breath. Lesley Mason said in his review of ''Animal's People'', "This is a book that should be part of the national curriculum through-out the world. Not only does it explore the outfall of one particular humanitarian and ecological disaster and the pitiful response to it by those responsible; but takes in the wider picture of the general attitude of richer people to the poorer and that of the so-called developed nations to those who have yet to claim a share of the power and the glory (or the muck and the money)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookbag.co.uk/reviews/index.php?title=Animal's_People_by_Indra_Sinha |title=Animal's People by Indra Sinha - TheBookbag.co.uk book review |publisher=Thebookbag.co.uk |date=2009-10-24 |accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;''New York Times''
"It (Khaufpur) is also the setting for his fiercely polemical — and unexpectedly bawdy — novel ''Animal’s People'', a finalist for the 2007 Man Booker Prize that reveals not a paradise but a blighted city."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/books/review/Mishan-t.html|title=Poisoned|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2014-10-14|first=Ligaya|last=Mishan|date=2008-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Blog Critics''
"Try to imagine for a moment what it must be like to be the people of Bhopal who have lived for twenty plus years watching family and friends die, descend into madness or give birth to stillborn babies. ''Animal's People'', the latest offering from Indian author Indra Sinha available from Simon &amp; Schuster Canada, does just that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marcus |first=Richard |url=http://blogcritics.org/book-review-animals-people-by-indra |title=Book Review: Animal’s People by Indra Sinha |publisher=Blogcritics |date=2007-09-28 |accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Washington Post''
''Washington Post'' said of ''Animal's People'', "The right writer has met the right tragedy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/20/AR2008032003105.html |title=Untouchable |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= 2008-03-23|accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Barnes and Noble
Eric Banks of ''Barnes and Noble Review'' said, "It isn't hard to figure why it hooked critics: Sinha controls language so magnificently in this novel...

'''Students for Bhopal''' (SfB) is an international network of students and supporters working in solidarity with the survivors of the [[Bhopal disaster]] – the world’s worst-ever industrial catastrophe - in their struggle for justice.  Through [[education]], [[grassroots organizing]] and [[non-violent]] [[direct action]], SfB builds pressure against [[Dow Chemical]] and the Indian Government to uphold the Bhopalis' demand for justice, and their fundamental [[human right]] to live free of chemical poison. It was coordinated by Ryan Bodanyi, who founded the organization in 2003.

==Relationship with survivors==

Students for Bhopal is guided by the demands, campaigns and vision of the survivors themselves. SfB was founded as the "student wing" of the [[International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal]] (ICJB), an international coalition of organizations and institutions dedicated to supporting the campaign of the Bhopal survivors. Four grassroots Bhopali organizations form the core of ICJB - '''Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Stationery Karmchari Sangh''', '''Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Purush Sangharsh Morcha''', '''Bhopal Group for Information and Action''' and '''Bhopal ki Awaaz''' – and provide the guidance and inspiration for its work around the globe, including the work of Students for Bhopal.

==Campaigns==

Students for Bhopal volunteers work within their own institutions and communities to build pressure on against Dow Chemical and the Indian Government to meet the demands of the Bhopali survivors. These campaigns can take a variety of forms, but often start with education and awareness-raising efforts. These not only lay the groundwork for future campaigns, but also create new [[advocates]] and volunteers as well.

Students have advocated for universities and colleges which own stock in Dow Chemical to either [[divest]] from the company, or support a [[shareholder resolution]] which requests that Dow report on the threat its inaction may pose to the company. Some universities and colleges do not hold stock in Dow Chemical, but do accept [[funding]] from them. In such cases Students for Bhopal chapters have demanded that their schools should reject funding from Dow until the corporation resolves its outstanding [[Liability (accounting)|liabilities]] in Bhopal.

Many universities and colleges also serve as [[Recruitment|recruiting]] grounds for Dow Chemical. Students for Bhopal volunteers have instead worked to educate their fellow students about Dow’s legacy of [[contamination]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] damage, urging them to sign a [[Oath|pledge]] not to work for Dow until it addresses its outstanding responsibilities in Bhopal.

Students for Bhopal has also worked to engage Dow’s [[Board of Directors]]. As Dow’s ultimate decision-making authority, SfB volunteers have continued to ask Dow’s Board members to take responsibility for Bhopal through letter writing campaigns, fax and email actions, phone calls, personal visits and [[protests]].

The Government of India has also been a target of the survivors’ demands, and Students for Bhopal members have echoed survivors' requests for safe drinking water, social and economic support, good [[healthcare]], and more through email, fax and phone actions, and protests outside of Indian offices, [[consulates]] and [[embassies]].

Students for Bhopal members have also passed city council resolutions in their communities, most notably in [[San Francisco]],&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco  Board of Supervisors Resolution [http://www.sfgov.org/site/uploadedfiles/bdsupvrs/resolutions04/r0254-04.pdf 0254-04] on 2004-04-29&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seattle]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studentsforbhopal.org/Assets/Images/seattlebhopalproclamation1.jpg Seattle City Council Proclamation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026030345/http://www.studentsforbhopal.org/Assets/Images/seattlebhopalproclamation1.jpg |date=26 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Seattle City Council observes Bhopal anniversary." Press Trust of India [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-11930059_ITM article] on 2005-12-04&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge City Council [http://www.cambridgema.gov/cityClerk/policyOrder.cfm?item_id=15575 Resolution] passed on 2006-09-25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actions==

Students for Bhopal members have launched campaigns and conducted numerous actions worldwide in support of actions and campaigns launched by Bhopali gas-disaster survivors.

===No Objection Certificate===

In 2004, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] ruled that Union Carbide could be held accountable for a comprehensive cleanup in Bhopal, but that the permission of the Government of India was needed before the court could order any [[Environmental remediation|remediation]]. The government was reluctant to submit the No Objection Certificate (NOC) to the Court, so Students for Bhopal and the Association for India's Development coordinated numerous actions as the 30 June deadline approached. These included faxes, emails and telephone calls of support, protests in front of Indian Consulates in Houston, Washington DC and New York, and a six-day hunger strike by Bhopal survivors.&lt;ref&gt;"Step closer to justice for Bhopal" Greenpeace [http://www.greenpeace.org/international/news/step-closer-to-justice-for-bho article] on 2004-06-23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution of Compensation===

Because the $470 million settlement received from Union Carbide was distributed over a 15-year period, more than $330 million in interest accrued by the time the settlement was distributed.  On 24 February 2004 Students for Bhopal and the Association for India’s Development launched an International Day of Action to pressure the Indian Government into distributing the interest to the survivors rather than using it for other purposes. Indian Consulates in the U.S. were targeted with emails and calls. Students in Canada wrote letters to the High Commission of India in Canada. Fifteen students met with the Governor of Madhya Pradesh and presented him with a petition demanding distribution of the earned interest, while students in New Delhi met with the Indian President to present the demands and ask for his support.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

===Clean Water===

Because the disaster contaminate water supplies 20,00 nearby residents need a permanent piped water supply.  This has not yet been implelmented and Students for Bhopal continues to advocate for a permanent piped supply of drinking water.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

===Stopping Dow in India===

We Feel Responsible, a major chapter of Students for Bhopal, lead a rally in [[Chennai]] as part of a larger movement by Bhopal survivors to demand the blacklisting of Dow by the Government and protest the Indian Oil Corporation’s plans to do business with a corporation that had outstanding liabilities in Bhopal.&lt;ref&gt;"Bhopal gas tragedy: Survivors on padayatra" [http://news.oneindia.in/2006/03/16/bhopal-gas-tragedy-survivors-on-padayatra-1142505393.html UNI article] on 2006-03-16&lt;/ref&gt;

===March to Delhi===

As a part of their ongoing efforts to get justice, Bhopal Gas Tragedy survivors along with volunteers from Students For Bhopal and other organizations are taking part in a 500 miles walk from Bhopal to New Delhi starting 20 February 2008. They are hoping to meet the Prime Minister of India and demand the setting up of a Special Commission which would monitor and provide medical care, rehabilitation to the victims of the gas leak, environmental cleanup and ensure safe drinking water for the city. Furthermore the activists are also demanding that the Ministry of Chemicals file for claims against Dow Chemical in MP high court with regards to the toxic cleanup of the affected area, the Govt. of India move for extradition of Warren Anderson (the CEO of Union Carbide at the time of the disaster), revoke approval given to Reliance for purchase of Union Carbide's Unipol technology which is intellectual property that should be confiscated because the corporation is absconding since 1992 and cancel the registration of pesticides, including Dursban, obtained by bribing Agriculture Ministry officials as established by Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Bhopal victims march for justice | newspaper=The Hindu | url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/bhopal-victims-march-for-justice/article3169676.ece | date=26 March 2006 | accessdate=6 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rajkumar Keswani''' (born 26 November 1950 in [[Bhopal, India]]) is a senior journalist. Keswani was the first journalist to bring attention to the safety lapses and impending [[Bhopal disaster]] that eventually came to pass at the town's [[Union Carbide]] pesticides plant overnight on 2–3 December 1984. Keswani had written several articles, from 1982 through 1984, detailing that safety standards at the plant were inadequate and that a catastrophic leak could result.

Keswani began to take an interest in the affairs of the Union Carbide Bhopal India plant in 1981 when Mohammad Ashraf, his friend who was a plant employee, spoke of possible dangers posed by leaks. He died in an accident at the plant on 24 December 1981 after inhaling phosgene. For internal information sources Keswani found two people who were fired — Bashirullah and Shankar Malviya who helped him to get hold of all manuals and confidential reports. It took Keswani nine months to write his first piece in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bhopal gas tragedy: The man who tried to expose Union Carbide and the warnings that were ignored|date=8 December 2014 | url=https://www.news18.com/videos/india/bhopal-gas-tragedy-7-730177.html | accessdate=24 January 2019|publisher=IBNLive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Raising alarm before the disaster ==
Reports of safety lapses in the plant had started surfacing in 1981 — three years before the disaster — when a minor gas leak killed an employee inside the plant. Keswani first wrote about inadequate safety standards on 26 September 1982 with a title "Bachaiye huzoor is shahar ko bachaiye" ("Save Please, Save This City") in the small weekly paper ''Rapat''. He repeated the warning in two follow-up articles on 1 October "Jwalamukhi ke muhane baitha Bhopal" ("Bhopal sitting on the brink of a volcano") and on 8 October "Na samjhoge to aakhir mit hi jaoge" ("If you don’t understand, you all shall be wiped out")  that year. On 5 October, four days after the second article, 18 people at the Union Carbide plant were exposed to a mixture of chloroform, methyl isocyanate and hydrochloric acid from a leaking valve. None were seriously harmed. 

In the article "Bhopal: On the Brink of a Disaster,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Verdict in Bhopal|url=https://zcomm.org/zmagazine/the-verdict-in-bhopal-by-john-raymond/|publisher=Zmagazine|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=THE BHOPAL DISASTER|url=http://www.cseindia.org/userfiles/THE%20BHOPAL%20DISASTER.pdf|accessdate=19 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528042900/http://www.cseindia.org/userfiles/THE%20BHOPAL%20DISASTER.pdf|archivedate=28 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keswani reported on a series of incidents and asserted that the leak on 5 October 1982 had affected thousands of residents of neighboring slum districts who fled in fear and returned only after eight hours. He also asserted in the article that in 1975, M.N. Buch, an Indian [[bureaucrat]], had asked Union Carbide to move the plant away from its present site because of the rapid growth of residential neighborhoods around it. Union Carbide were lucky because Buch was transferred from his post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indian Journalist Offered Warning|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/11/world/indian-journalist-offered-warning.html|accessdate=19 December 2014|publisher=The New York Times|date=11 December 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bhopal gas disaster: Corporate negligence with deadly consequences|date=3 June 2010|url=https://www.academia.edu/7031704/Bhopal_gas_disaster_Corporate_negligence_with_deadly_consequences|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bhopal Gas Verdict: Travesty of Justice|url=http://www.dayafterindia.com/detail.php?headline=content&amp;catid=614|accessdate=19 December 2014|publisher=The Day After}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keswani reported a [[Telex]] exchange Union Carbide India manager J. Mukund (one of the accused who was convicted on 7 June) sent asking for advice about coating the pipes. The U.S.-based parent company sent him a message saying that the best material for piping would be too expensive and too difficult to acquire. They highlighted how [[Union Carbide]] escaped their responsibility when they were advising Bhopal to economise on safety measures and instructed Bhopal to use cheaper material. They were advising it to compromise on safety. Mukund's message was sent on 27 August 1984 — a few months before the fateful leak.

Being a journalist, Keswami initially knew nothing about the chemistry and composition of the chemicals or their behaviour. His conviction that the Union Carbide Bhopal plant was headed for disaster grew out of two small pieces of information that he happened to read independently. One was in a Union Carbide report that mentioned in passing that several of the gases that [[methyl isocyanate]] (MIC) broke down into, such as phosgene, were "heavier than air." Reference to phosgene caught his attention while reading an article on WWII; it had been one of the chemicals used in the German [[gas chambers]]. With these two incidental pieces of information, Keswami launched an investigation that convinced him that Bhopal was on the road to tragedy. In spite of the shrillness of his warnings, no one paid him attention. Even his friends thought he was crazy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=He predicted the disaster, but no one listened|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/He-predicted-the-disaster-but-no-one-listened/articleshow/6025952.cms|accessdate=19 December 2014|publisher=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life after the disaster ==
After the disaster, Keswani was interviewed on radio and television shows, as he was the only journalist who knew anything about the Union Carbide Bhopal plant. He was called a "Cassandra" and a "lone voice in the wilderness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Five Past Midnight in Bhopal|publisher=Scribner;|isbn=9780446530880|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keswani became the youngest person ever to receive the prestigious Indian B.D. Goenka Award for Excellence in [[Journalism]] in 1985. In his acceptance speech Keswani noted that he might be the first to receive the award for such a spectacular journalistic failure "had he succeed at his task no one would have ever taken note."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=G 1985|first1=Bradford, G.|title=We All Live In Bhopal, Fifth Estate.

'''''Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain''''' is a 2014 [[Historical period drama|historical drama]] film set amidst the [[Bhopal disaster]] that had occurred in India on 2–3 December 1984. It is directed by Ravi Kumar and features [[Martin Sheen]], [[Mischa Barton]], [[Kal Penn]], [[Rajpal Yadav]], [[Tannishtha Chatterjee]], and [[Fagun Thakrar]] in important roles. Benjamin Wallfisch composed the film's music. Kumar got the idea of making a film based on the Bhopal disaster after he read a book based on it. Shot over a period of 18 months, it was originally slated for a late 2010 release. However, the lack of responses from distributors kept on delaying the release.

In April 2013, a new trailer was released, and the film received a market screening at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]] on 16 May and 19 May. It was also screened at Pan Asia, Dingle and the [[Tokyo International Film Festival|Tokyo International]] film festivals. ''Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain'' was released in the United States on 7 November 2014 and in India on 5 December 2014. A private screening of the film was held at the youth assembly in the [[United Nations]] on 7 August 2014.

The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the actors' portrayal of their respective characters but found the film underwhelming. A few organisations fighting for the rights of the victims of the tragedy blamed the film for presenting the facts in a distorted manner. Kumar and Sheen denied these allegations. The [[Madhya Pradesh]] government exempted the film from paying tax.

== Plot ==
In 1984, a few months before the [[Bhopal disaster]], Dilip ([[Rajpal Yadav]]), a rickshaw driver, loses his pay source as his rickshaw breaks down while transporting an employee to the Union Carbide pesticide plant in [[Bhopal]]. Dilip lives in the slums around the plant with his wife, a son and his sister. He gets a job in the plant as a labourer, and is happy since his daily wage is restored.

The plant witnesses a drop in its revenue due to lower sales of pesticides, and in order to reduce the loss the officials neglect safety and maintenance. Questioning the chemicals used in the plant, Motwani ([[Kal Penn]]), a tabloid reporter publishes reports in his makeshift printing press which are disregarded by most of the officials and workers. Roy ([[Joy Sengupta]]), the in-charge for the safety of the plant expresses his concerns. The officials however ignore his warnings, and a worker is killed when a drop of [[methyl isocyanate]] leaking from a pipeline lands on his arm. The officials deem the worker's irresponsibility as the cause of the accident and the plant continues to function. Dilip is given a better-paying vacant job in the plant despite lacking the skill to operate machinery. A gas leak is prevented by Roy when water is mixed with methyl isocyanate, and in an attempt to stop people from panicking, the official in the plant sabotages the warning siren.

[[Warren Anderson (American businessman)|Warren Anderson]] ([[Martin Sheen]]), the CEO of [[Union Carbide]], visits the plant to inspect its functionality, where he is briefed about a plan to connect two additional tanks for storage of methyl isocyanate to increase the output of the plant, ignoring the deteriorated condition of the tanks. Motwani meanwhile meets Eva Gascon ([[Mischa Barton]]), a reporter in the [[Paris Match]], and persuades her to get an interview of Anderson. She impersonates the identity of an [[Associated Press]] reporter, but fails as her true identity is exposed in between the interview. Motwani convinces Dilip of the danger posed by the chemicals.

As the date of the disaster nears, Dilip arranges a loan for the wedding of his sister. Roy later explains how the company is ignoring safety standards, and that how a future leak might become uncontrolled as the officials had turned off safety measures to reduce the maintenance costs. Roy gives his resignation to the company and advises Dilip not to talk about the plant's safety if he wishes to retain his job. Dilip makes a phone call to Motwani describing what Roy just said, and expresses his fear about the plant's safety, saying he will return to the rickshaw-pulling business as soon as his sister is married.

To overcome the increasing revenue loss, the officials shut down the plant, firing most of the workers, including Dilip. The plant officials then order the usage of the remaining methyl isocyanate as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Dilip is busy with the wedding of his sister, and Roy has a final look of the control room. The safety measures fail and a runaway reaction follows. The faulty tanks cause the gas to start leaking, and an attempt to contain the leak fails. The gas escapes to the surroundings and is carried east by the wind. Motwani rushes to alert the people in the vicinity of the plant to vacate and head west, since the warning sirens were previously sabotaged. He meets Dilip, who ignores the warning and asks Motwani to leave the area without causing any hindrance to the wedding. Meanwhile, the guests experience irritation in the eyes and discomfort in breathing. Dilip senses the danger and visits the plant, realising that the plant had been compromised. He rushes back to his residence where he finds his family and relatives dying from acute exposure to the toxic gas. He carries away his son, paying farewell to his wife's corpse and flees the slum.

As the gas shows its effects, a nearby hospital is filled with hundreds of patients reporting cyanide poisoning, and the lack of antidote results in most of the patients' death. Dilip, on his deathbed, and using the last of his strength, rips off his Union Carbide identity badge and after flinging it away, rests his dead son on the ground. He eventually accepts his fate to die in the highly toxic gas cloud and succumbs to the toxic gas, dying by his son's side. The story jumps to the present day, where a blind boy is holding Dilip's identity badge, and the film ends with Motwani narrating the words "Whatever may be the cause of the disaster, Carbide never left Bhopal". A photo montage depicts the aftermath of the disaster, and pictures of the characters and their real-life counterparts.

The '''Remember Bhopal Museum''' is a museum in [[Bhopal]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]] that commemorates the [[Bhopal disaster]]. It collects and exhibits artifacts and records of the affected communities. The museum was opened on 2 December 2014, the 30th anniversary of the disaster.

== History ==
The [[Bhopal disaster]] was caused by a [[gas leak]] that occurred at the [[Union Carbide India Limited]] (UCIL) [[pesticide]] plant in [[Bhopal]] on 2 December 1984, and became the [[List of accidents and disasters by death toll#Industrial disasters|largest industrial disaster by death toll]].&lt;ref name="BBC2010"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8725140.stm|title=Bhopal trial: Eight convicted over India gas disaster |date=2010-06-07|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2010-06-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607185745/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8725140.stm|archivedate=2010-06-07|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Yaad-e-Hadsa]], a memorial museum, was created by survivors of the disaster.&lt;ref name="Sharma2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma|first=Shalini|chapter=The Politics of Remembering Bhopal|title=Displaced Heritage: Responses to Disaster, Trauma, and Loss|pp=112–115|editor1-first=Ian|editor1-last=Convery|editor2-first=Gerard|editor2-last=Corsane|editor3-first=Peter|editor3-last=Davis|isbn=9781843839637|date=2014|publisher=[[Boydell &amp; Brewer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its exhibits, such as clothing and other belongings of those who had died, were donated by survivors. However, records of the origins of the exhibits were eventually lost by the organisers.&lt;ref name="Chari2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://scroll.in/article/691816/thirty-years-later-a-museum-wants-to-change-the-way-we-look-at-the-survivors-of-the-bhopal-gas-leak|last=Chari|first=Mridula|date=2014-11-30|title=Thirty years later, a museum wants to change the way we look at the survivors of the Bhopal gas leak|accessdate=2015-08-12|archivedate=2015-05-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515233629/http://scroll.in/article/691816/thirty-years-later-a-museum-wants-to-change-the-way-we-look-at-the-survivors-of-the-bhopal-gas-leak|work=Scroll.in|publisher=[[Scroll Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rama Lakshmi, who is a journalist, museologist and oral historian, and Shalini Sharma, who is an activist and an assistant professor at the [[Tata Institute for Social Sciences]], decided to collect accounts from the survivors directly to link with the donated objects, to be exhibited at a new memorial museum.&lt;ref name="Chari2014"/&gt;

In 2009, the [[Government of Madhya Pradesh|Madhya Pradesh government]] and the [[Union Government of India|Union Government]] made proposals to build a memorial of the gas tragedy, but the proposals failed.&lt;ref name="Dutta2014"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dutta|first=Anup|date=2014-12-02|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2856576/Activists-turn-three-room-flat-museum-Bhopal-gas-tragedy.html|accessdate=2015-08-12|archivedate=2015-08-12|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150812122157/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2856576/Activists-turn-three-room-flat-museum-Bhopal-gas-tragedy.html|deadurl=no|title=Activists turn three-room flat into museum for Bhopal gas tragedy|newspaper=[[Mail Online]]|publisher=[[Daily Mail and General Trust]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Remember Bhopal Trust was formed in 2012 by survivors of the disaster and activists campaigning for restitution for the victims of the disaster. It was formed with the aim of helping sustain the memory of the incident, and to organise commemorative activities, with a focus on the concerns of the victims and survivors of the disaster.&lt;ref name="RBT"&gt;{{cite web|title=About us - Remember Bhopal Trust|url=http://rememberbhopal.net/about-us/|publisher=Remember Bhopal Trust|accessdate=2015-08-12|deadurl=no|archivedate=2015-08-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812123745/http://rememberbhopal.net/about-us/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December 2014, the Remember Bhopal Museum was opened by the Remember Bhopal Trust. The museum is located in a converted flat near the site.&lt;ref name="Dutta2014"/&gt; According to its curator Rama Lakshmi, it is the first museum in India focusing on a "contemporary social movement for justice". The project, which was the trust's first, is co-ordinated by Shalini Sharma.&lt;ref name="Shaini2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article/The-Museum-Of-Memories/292767|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206015043/http://www.outlookindia.com/article/The-Museum-Of-Memories/292767|date=2014-12-03|archivedate=2014-12-06|accessdate=2015-08-12|last=Shaini|first=K.S.|title=The Museum of Memories|work=[[Outlook India]]|publisher=[[Outlook Publishing India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jennings2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumcommons.com/2014/12/remember-bhopal-museum-victory-museums-difficult-history.html|title=Remember Bhopal Museum: A Victory for Museums of Difficult History|last=Jennings|first=Gretchen|date=2014-12-07|deadurl=no|archivedate=2015-08-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812130702/http://www.museumcommons.com/2014/12/remember-bhopal-museum-victory-museums-difficult-history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibits ==
The museum exhibits artefacts, oral histories, photographs, protest songs and campaign posters that have emerged in the movement for justice for the victims of the Bhopal disaster.

The survivor groups have worked with Lakshmi and other museum professionals to design and create their own memorial museum, filled with posters, photographs, and artefacts, such as a small victim’s dress, a stopped pocket watch–donated by the families of victims and survivors. Survivors have given to the museum personal objects that are often their last tangible link to those who died because of the gas leak. Many others have recounted their harrowing tales of survival and struggle. The museum’s narrative is shaped by their stories and objects.

== Administration ==
The central goal of the Remember Bhopal Museum is to focus on the voices and concerns of the survivors, as opposed to the government or the industry, in museum or memorial projects.

Rama Lakshmi, Washington Post's India correspondent (and also a museologist) is the curator of the Remember Bhopal Museum.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.saddahaq.com/objects-in-the-museum-are-not-just-of-that-night-but-of-the-last-30-years-of-their-struggle-rama-lakshmi&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum is housed in a rented building, owned by a disaster-affected family, around 2.5&amp;nbsp;km away from the Union Carbide factory.

The museum does not accept any government or corporate funds.&lt;ref name="Chari2014"/&gt;

'''Methyl isocyanate''' ('''MIC''') is an [[organic compound]] with the molecular formula CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NCO. Synonyms are isocyanatomethane, methyl carbylamine and MIC. Methyl isocyanate is an intermediate chemical in the production of [[carbamate]] [[pesticide]]s (such as [[carbaryl]], [[carbofuran]], [[methomyl]], and [[aldicarb]]). It has also been used in the production of [[rubber]]s and [[adhesive]]s. As a highly [[toxic]] and irritating material, it is extremely hazardous to human health.

== Physical properties ==

Methyl isocyanate is a colorless, poisonous, [[Lachrymatory agent|lachrymatory]] ([[Tears|tearing]] agent), flammable liquid.&lt;ref name="Union Carbide 1967"&gt;Union Carbide Corporation "Methyl Isocyanate" Product Information Publication, F-41443, November 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; It is soluble in water to 6–10 parts per 100 parts, but it also reacts with water (see [[#Reactions|Reactions]] below).

== Manufacture ==

Methyl isocyanate is usually manufactured by the reaction of [[Methylamine|monomethylamine]] and [[phosgene]]. For large scale production, it is advantageous to combine these reactants at higher temperature in the gas phase. A mixture of methyl isocyanate and two moles of [[hydrogen chloride]] is formed, but N-methylcarbamoyl chloride (MCC) forms as the mixture is condensed, leaving one [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of hydrogen chloride as a gas.

[[File:MMA plus Phosgene diagram.svg|none]]
The methyl isocyanate is obtained by treating the MCC with a tertiary amine, such as [[dimethylaniline|N,N-dimethylaniline]], or with [[pyridine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=2480088 |status=patent |inventor=Slocombe, R. J.; Hardy, E. E. |title=Process of Producing Carbamyl Chlorides |gdate=1949-08-23 |assign1=Monsanto}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by separating it by using distillation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=FR |number=1400863 |status=patent |inventor=Merz, W. |title=Procédé et dispositif de préparation d'isocyanates d'alkyle |assign1=Bayer |gdate=1965-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MCC to MIC &amp; HCl.svg|none]]
Methyl isocyanate is also manufactured from N-methylformamide and air. In the latter process, it is immediately consumed in a closed-loop process to make methomyl.&lt;ref&gt;Chemical Week, ''"A fleeting existence for toxic-gas molecules"'' p. 9, June 12, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Other manufacturing methods have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=DE |number=2828259 |status=patent |inventor=Giesselmann, G.; Guenther, K.; Fuenten, W. |title=Verfahren zur Herstellung von Methyl Isocyanate |gdate=1980-01-10 |assign1=Degussa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Chemical Week |year=1985 |title=A safer method for making carbamates |page=136 |volume=1985b |issue=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==

Methyl isocyanate reacts readily with many substances that contain N-H or O-H groups. With water, it forms [[urea|1,3-dimethylurea]] and [[carbon dioxide]] with the evolution of heat (325 calories per gram of MIC):

[[File:MIC &amp; water to DMU &amp; TMB.png|none]]
At 25&amp;nbsp;°C, in excess water, half of the MIC is consumed in 9 min.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Castro EA, Moodie RB, Sansom PJ |title=The kinetics of hydrolysis of methyl and phenyl isocyanates |journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Perkin Transactions 2 |year=1985 |volume=1985 |issue=5 |pages=737–742 |doi=10.1039/P29850000737}}&lt;/ref&gt; if the heat is not efficiently removed from the mixture, the rate of the reaction will increase and rapidly cause the MIC to boil. If MIC is in excess, [[Biuret|1,3,5-trimethylbiuret]] is formed along with [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Union Carbide 1967" /&gt; [[Alcohols]] and [[phenols]], which contain an O-H group, react slowly with MIC, but the reaction can be catalyzed by trialkyl[[amine]]s or dialkyltin dicarboxylate. [[Oxime]]s, [[hydroxylamine]]s, and [[enol]]s also react with MIC to form methylcarbamates.&lt;ref name="Union Carbide 1967" /&gt; These reactions produce the products described below ([[#Uses|Uses]]).

[[File:MIC plus 1-naphthol to carbaryl.svg|none]]
[[Ammonia]], primary, and secondary [[amine]]s rapidly react with MIC to form substituted [[urea]]s. Other N-H compounds, such as amides and [[urea]]s, react much more slowly with MIC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=March J |title=Advanced Organic Chemistry |edition=3rd |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York |year=1985 |page=802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also reacts with itself to form a trimer or higher molecular weight polymers. In the presence of [[catalysts]], MIC reacts with itself to form a solid trimer, trimethyl isocyanurate, or a higher molecular weight polymer:

[[File:MIC to trimer.svg|none]]
[[Alkoxide|Sodium methoxide]], [[Phosphine|triethyl phosphine]], [[ferric chloride]] and certain other metal compounds catalyze the formation of the MIC-trimer, while the high-molecular-weight polymer formation is catalyzed by certain trialkyl[[amine]]s. Since the formation of the MIC trimer is [[exothermic]] (298 calories per gram of MIC), the reaction can lead to violent boiling of the MIC. The high-molecular-weight polymer hydrolyzes in hot water to form the trimethyl isocyanurate. Since catalytic metal salts can be formed from impurities in commercial grade MIC and steel, this product must not be stored in steel drums or tanks.&lt;ref name="Union Carbide 1967" /&gt;

== Hazards ==

Methyl isocyanate is extremely [[toxic]]. The threshold limit value set by the American Conference on Government Industrial Hygienists is 0.02 [[Parts per million|ppm]]. MIC is toxic by inhalation, ingestion and contact in quantities as low as 0.4 [[Parts per million|ppm]]. Exposure symptoms includes coughing, [[chest]] pain, [[dyspnea]], [[asthma]], irritation of the [[Human eye|eye]]s, [[human nose|nose]] and [[throat]], as well as [[skin]] damage. Higher levels of exposure, over 21 ppm, can result in pulmonary or lung [[edema]], [[emphysema]] and [[hemorrhage]]s, bronchial [[pneumonia]] and [[death]]. Although the odor of methyl isocyanate cannot be detected at 5 ppm by most people, its potent [[Lachrymatory agent|lachrymal]] properties provide an excellent warning of its presence (at a concentration of 2–4 parts per million (ppm) subject's eyes are irritated, while at 21 ppm, subjects could not tolerate the presence of methyl isocyanate in air).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kimmerle G, Eben A |title=Zur Toxizität von Methylisocyanat und dessen quantitativer Bestimmung in der Luft |journal=Archiv für Toxikologie |year=1964 |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=235–241 |doi=10.1007/bf00577897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper care must be taken to store methyl isocyanate because of its ease of exothermically polymerizing (see [[#Reactions|Reactions]]) and its similar sensitivity to water. Only stainless steel or glass containers may be safely used; the MIC must be stored at temperatures below {{convert|40|°C}} and preferably at {{convert|4|°C}}.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

The toxic effect of the compound was apparent in the 1984 [[Bhopal disaster]], when around {{convert|42000|kg}} of methyl isocyanate and other gases were released from the underground reservoirs of the [[Union Carbide India Limited]] (UCIL) factory, over a populated area on December 3, 1984, killing about 3,500 people immediately and 15,000 more over the next several years.&lt;ref name="convictions"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8725140.stm|title=Bhopal trial: Eight convicted over India gas disaster |date=7 June 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=7 June 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607185745/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8725140.stm| archivedate= 7 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:W. Eugene Smith - Tomoko Uemura in Her Bath.jpg|thumb|right|434px|''Tomoko Uemura in Her Bath'' (1971) by W. Eugene Smith]]
'''''Tomoko Uemura in Her Bath''''' is a [[photograph]] taken by American [[photojournalist]] [[W. Eugene Smith]] in 1971. Many commentators regard ''Tomoko'' as Smith's greatest work. The black-and-white photo depicts a mother cradling her severely deformed, naked daughter in a traditional Japanese bathroom. The mother, '''Ryoko Uemura''', agreed to deliberately pose the startlingly intimate photograph with Smith to illustrate the terrible effects of [[Minamata disease]] (a type of [[mercury poisoning]]) on the body and mind of her daughter '''Tomoko'''. Upon publication the photo became world-famous, significantly raising the international profile of Minamata disease and the struggle of the victims for recognition and [[Damages|compensation]]. At the wishes of Tomoko Uemura's family, the photograph was withdrawn from further publication in 1997, 20 years after Tomoko's death.

Alternate names given for the photograph include: ''Tomoko in the Bath'', ''Tomoko and Mother in the Bath'' and ''Tomoko is Bathed by her Mother''.

==Capture==
[[W. Eugene Smith]] and his wife Aileen Smith lived in [[Minamata, Kumamoto|Minamata]] from 1971 to 1973, with the specific aim of bringing [[Minamata disease]] to public attention. During those three years Smith took thousands of photographs, leading to the production of numerous magazine articles, exhibitions and a book. Smith realised that a single, striking photograph was required to become a symbol of Minamata disease. In Smith's own words, "It grew and grew in my mind that to me the symbol of Minamata was, finally, a picture of this woman [the mother], and the child, Tomoko. One day I simply said […] let us try to make that symbolic picture".&lt;ref name=Maddow&gt;Maddow, Ben. (1985). ''Let Truth Be the Prejudice: W.Eugene Smith His Life and Photographs''. Aperture&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomoko's parents allowed Smith to photograph their daughter's body, in the hope that it might draw attention to the plight of similar families in Minamata and other pollution victims all over the world. Ryoko Uemura was keen for the photograph to portray her daughter in a sympathetic manner and actively collaborated with Smith to stage the perfect shot. Jim Hughes, (a biographer) said of Smith, "Although he wanted a photograph that would clearly show Tomoko's deformed body, Gene told me it was Ryoko Uemura, the mother, who suggested the bathing chamber".&lt;ref name=RIP&gt;The Digital Journalist ''[http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue0007/hughes.htm Tomoko Uemura, R.I.P.]'', Article by Jim Hughes&lt;/ref&gt; The photograph was finally taken on a chilly afternoon in December 1971, with Ryoko, Tomoko, Smith and his wife Aileen all cramped into the small bathing room.

==Publication and impact==
The photograph was first published in the June 2, 1972, edition of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine as the centrepiece of a short Minamata [[photo essay]]. This was expanded into book form featuring the full series of photographs taken by Smith during his stay in [[Minamata, Kumamoto|Minamata]]. The issue of [[Minamata disease]] and the plights of the victims was brought to worldwide attention by this photo essay and book. As well, Smith was attacked and beaten by ''[[yakuza]]'' hired by Chisso, the polluting corporation.&lt;ref name="hughes1989"&gt;{{cite book | author=Jim Hughes | title=W. Eugene Smith: Shadow &amp; Substance: The Life and Work of an American Photographer | publisher=McGraw-Hill: New York |date=October 1989 | oclc=19981194 | isbn=978-0-07-031123-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hughes2000"&gt;{{cite web | author=Jim Hughes | title=Tomoko Uemura, R.I.P. | url=http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue0007/hughes.htm | accessdate=2015-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The striking nature of the photograph ensured that it became world-famous very quickly. The Uemura family found themselves under a media spotlight. Tomoko's father, Yoshio Uemura said, "We were faced with an increasing number of interviews. Thinking that it would aid the struggle for the eradication of pollution, we agreed to interviews and photographs while the organizations that were working on our behalf used the photograph of Tomoko frequently". However the increased attention was not without its drawbacks. Rumors began to circulate in the Minamata community that the Uemuras were benefiting financially from the publicity. Some local people (who relied on the polluting [[Chisso|Chisso Corporation]] for their livelihoods) were fiercely opposed to the Minamata disease victims' struggle for compensation. All these pressures added up significantly for the Uemura family. "I do not think," Yoshio Uemura stated, "that anybody outside our family can begin to imagine how unbearable the persistent rumors made our daily lives... Although she could not speak herself, I am sure that Tomoko felt that her family were worried for her".&lt;ref name=RIP/&gt;

Tomoko Uemura died in 1977 at the age of 21.

==Withdrawal==
In 1997 a French television production company contacted the Uemura family, asking permission to use Smith's famous photograph in a documentary about the most important photographs of the 20th century, and to interview the family once again about Minamata disease and the photograph. However, by this stage, 20 years after his daughter's death, Yoshio Uemura had changed his mind. He refused any interviews and disliked the idea of Tomoko's image being further exploited: "I wanted Tomoko to be laid to rest and this feeling was growing steadily", he said.&lt;ref name=RIP/&gt;

After W. Eugene Smith's death in 1978 the copyright of his Minamata photographs passed to his ex-wife Aileen Smith. Upon hearing the reaction of the Uemura family to the request of the TV company, she travelled to Minamata and met with them. She decided to grant the copyright of the photograph to the family, so that they might have the right of decision regarding its use. Aileen Smith said, "This photograph would mean nothing if it did not honor Tomoko. This photograph would be a profanity if it continued to be issued against the will of Tomoko and her family. Because this was a statement about Tomoko's life, it must honor that life and by it her death."&lt;ref name=Aileen&gt;Aileen Archive ''[http://www.journeyamerica.us/tomoko-and-mother-in-the-bath/ The Photograph "Tomoko and Mother in the Bath"]'' - Statement by Aileen Smith.&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Nihongo|'''Chisso Corporation'''|チッソ株式会社|Chisso kabushiki kaisha}}, since 2012 reorganized as JNC (Japan New Chisso),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chisso Company Profile|url=http://www.chisso.co.jp/english/company/index.html|accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[:Category:Chemical companies of Japan|Japanese chemical company]]. It is an important supplier of [[liquid crystal]] used for [[LCD]]s, but is best known for its role in the 34-year-long pollution of the water supply in [[Minamata, Kumamoto|Minamata]], [[Japan]] that [[Minamata disease|led to thousands of deaths and victims of disease]].

Between 1932 and 1968, Chisso's chemical factory in Minamata released large quantities of industrial [[wastewater]] that was contaminated with highly [[toxicity|toxic]] [[methylmercury]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rNNhhuURbLIC&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;ots=SCiSJKey7G&amp;dq=chisso%20yakuza&amp;pg=PA165#v=onepage&amp;q=chisso%20yakuza&amp;f=false Yakuza: Japan's Criminal Underworld], by David E. Kaplan &amp; Alec Dubro&lt;/ref&gt; This [[poisonous|poison]] water [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulated]] in local sea life that was then consumed by the immediate population. As a result of this contamination, 2,265 individuals in the area were inflicted with what is now known as [[Minamata disease]]. 1,784 of those victims died as a result of the poisoning and/or the disease.&lt;ref name=officialnumbers&gt;Official government figure as of March 2001. See [http://www.env.go.jp/en/chemi/hs/minamata2002/ch2.html "Minamata Disease: The History and Measures, ch2"]&lt;/ref&gt; Those who were afflicted with the disease developed skeletomuscular deformities and lost the ability to perform motor functions such as walking. Many also lost significant amounts of vision, as well as hearing and speech capabilities. Severe cases presented with insanity, paralysis, coma and then death within weeks of the onset of symptoms.

As of March 2001, over 10,000 individuals had received financial remuneration from Chisso to compensate them for the harm caused by the chemical release.&lt;ref name=compensationnumbers&gt;See [http://www.nimd.go.jp/archives/english/index.html "Minamata Disease Archives"], Frequently asked questions, Question 6 &lt;!-- More recent figures required! --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004, Chisso Corporation had paid $86 million in compensation, and, in the same year, the company was ordered to clean up its contamination.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Hightower (2008). ''[[Diagnosis Mercury: Money, Politics and Poison]]'', Island Press, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the incident remains controversial for not only the poisoning itself but also for the tactics that the company used to suppress the negative aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;''Japan Focus'': [http://www.japanfocus.org/-Eric-Johnston/1994 Minamata at 50: The Tragedy Deepens]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chisso is a member of the [[Mizuho Financial Group|Mizuho]] [[keiretsu]].

== History ==

=== Foundation ===

In 1906, [[Shitagau Noguchi]], an [[electrical engineering]] graduate of [[Tokyo Imperial University]], founded the {{nihongo|Sogi Electric Company|曾木電気株式会社|Sogi Denki Kabushiki Kaisha}} which operated a [[hydroelectric power station]] in [[Ōkuchi, Kagoshima|Ōkuchi]], [[Kagoshima Prefecture]]. The power station supplied electricity for the gold mines in Ōkuchi but had overcapacity. To make use of the surplus power, in 1908, Noguchi founded the {{nihongo|Japan Carbide Company|日本カーバイド商会|Nihon Kaabaido Shōkai}} which operated a [[carbide]] factory in the coastal town of [[Minamata, Kumamoto|Minamata]], [[Kumamoto Prefecture]], about 30&amp;nbsp;km northwest of Ōkuchi. In the same year he merged the two companies to form the {{nihongo|'''Japan Nitrogenous Fertilizer Company'''|日本窒素肥料株式会社|Nihon Chisso Hiryō Kabushiki Kaisha}} - usually referred to as '''Nichitsu'''.

=== Expansion ===
In 1909, Noguchi purchased the rights to the [[Frank-Caro process]], whereby atmospheric [[nitrogen]] was combined with [[calcium carbide]] (a key product of the young company) to produce [[calcium cyanamide]], a chemical [[fertilizer]]. Nitrogenous fertilizers were key to boosting agricultural production in [[Japan]] at the time, due to its lack of arable land and the small-scale nature of its farms, so the company found a ready market for its product. Nichitsu also branched out into other products produced from [[calcium carbide]], beginning production of [[acetic acid]], [[ammonia]], [[explosives]] and [[butanol]].

Production of [[ammonium sulfate]] (another chemical fertilizer) started in 1914 at a plant in [[Kagami, Kumamoto|Kagami]], [[Kumamoto Prefecture]], using a [[nitrogen fixation]] process - a Japan first. Sales of ammonium sulfate were increasing year-on-year as were market prices. A new plant was opened at the [[Minamata, Kumamoto|Minamata]] factory in 1918 where it was able to produce ammonium sulfate for 70 yen per ton and sell it for five and a half times the cost. These massive profits enabled Nichitsu to survive the subsequent drop in prices after the return of foreign competition into the Japanese market after the end of [[World War I]] in Europe in September 1918.

After the war, Noguchi visited Europe and decided Nichitsu should pioneer an alternative synthesis of [[ammonium sulfate]] in Japan. In 1924, the Nichitsu plant at [[Nobeoka, Miyazaki|Nobeoka]] began production using the [[Casale ammonia synthesis]] which required the use of extremely high temperatures and pressures. Once the process was proved a success, the [[Minamata, Kumamoto|Minamata]] plant was converted to the process and began mass production.

Nichitsu grew steadily, invested its profits in new technology and expanded production into new areas and slowly became a large conglomerate of many different companies.&lt;ref name=George&gt;George, Timothy S. (2001). ''Minamata: Pollution and the Struggle for Democracy in Postwar Japan''. Harvard University Asia Center. {{ISBN|0-674-00785-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nichitsu in Korea ===
In 1924, Shitagau Noguchi decided to expand Nichitsu into [[Korea]]. In those days, Korea was a [[Korea under Japanese rule|colony of Japan]].

In 1926, he established two companies in Korea as subsidiaries of Nichitsu, mirroring the foundation of the parent company: {{nihongo|Korea Hydroelectric Power Company|朝鮮水力電気株式会社|Chōsen Suiryoku Denki Kabushiki Kaisha}} and {{nihongo|Korea Nitrogenous Fertilizer Company|朝鮮窒素肥料株式会社|Chōsen Chisso Hiryō Kabushiki Kaisha}}. Noguchi wanted to repeat his success in Ōkuchi and Minamata, but on an even greater scale in Korea.

The power company constructed hydroelectric power plants one after another along rivers draining into the [[Yalu River]]. In 1927, the fertilizer subsidiary built a huge chemical complex in [[Hungnam]]. The hydroelectric power plants supplied electricity for the chemical plant, in the same way as the Ōkuchi power plant had done so for the Minamata chemical factory.

Nichitsu invested Korea more aggressively than any other Japanese company. It and its subsidiaries grew rapidly in Korea, and came to be recognized as an emerging [[zaibatsu]].

The difference between Nichitsu's zaibatsu and established zaibatsu like [[Mitsubishi]] and [[Mitsui]] was that Nichitsu did not have its own bank and insurance company. Nichitsu therefore relied on government-controlled banks.

=== Dissolution and reorganization ===
As Japan lost the [[Second World War]] in 1945, Nichitsu and its zaibatsu collapsed and was forced to abandon all properties and interests in Korea. Furthermore, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] that [[occupied Japan]] ordered the dismissal of the company, regarding it as a company that adhered to the militarism government.

In 1950, the {{nihongo|'''New Japan Nitrogenous Fertilizer Company'''|新日本窒素肥料株式会社|Shin Nihon Chisso Hiryō Kabushiki Kaisha}}, usually referred to as '''Shin Nichitsu''', was founded as a successor of the old company. Other successor companies include [[Asahi Kasei]] and [[Sekisui Chemical]].

=== Minamata disease ===
{{Main|Minamata disease}}

Nichitsu had started production of [[acetaldehyde]] using a [[mercury (element)|mercury]] [[catalyst]] at its Minamata plant in May 1932, and Shin Nichitsu continued production after the war. The plant discharged wastewater from its acetaldehyde plant into [[Minamata Bay]] via [[Hyakken Harbour]]. The wastewater contained many pollutants and poisonous substances including methylmercury, a highly toxic chemical.

This chemical was absorbed by fish and shellfish and bioaccumulated up the [[food chain]]. People who unknowingly ate the fish over many years suffered from severe mercury poisoning. [[Hajime Hosokawa]], a doctor at a Shin Nichitsu's company hospital, officially reported on May 1, 1956 an "epidemic of an unknown disease of the central nervous system", marking the official discovery of Minamata disease.

In 1963, doctors at [[Kumamoto University]] concluded that the cause of Minamata disease was mercury emitted by Shin Nihon Chisso Hiryo. In 1965, the company changed its name to {{nihongo|'''Chisso Corporation'''|チッソ株式会社|Chisso Kabushiki Kaisha}}. In May 1968, Chisso finally stopped using a [[mercury (element)|mercury]] [[catalyst]] in the production of [[acetaldehyde]]. In 1969, patients sued Chisso for compensation. Many lawsuits were filed against Chisso after 1969, and some of them go on even now.

Chisso president later chairman Yutaka Egashira (Later maternal grandfather of [[Masako, Crown Princess of Japan]]) used ''[[yakuza]]'' in order to threaten and silence patients and their supporters.&lt;ref name=kaplan/&gt; Patients and their supporters started the "single shareholder" movement by buying one share of Chisso each, which was aimed at accusing the executives of Chisso in its general meeting. A thousand of the single shareholders participating in the movement gathered in front of a hall in [[Osaka]] to attend the general meeting called on November 28, 1970, but the company prevented them from entering the hall by asking yakuza to become shareholders and occupy the hall. The meeting ended in five minutes with all the bills submitted by the board approved.&lt;ref name=kaplan&gt;David E. Kaplan and Alec Dubro. ''Yakuza: Japan's Criminal Underworld''. University of California Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-520-21561-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Chisso had American photographer and photo-journalist [[W. Eugene Smith]] beaten by yakuza goons after Smith published a highly regarded photo-essay showing the caustic injuries and birth defects Chisso had caused the Minamata population.&lt;ref name="hughes1989"&gt;{{cite book | author=Jim Hughes | title=W. Eugene Smith: Shadow &amp; Substance: The Life and Work of an American Photographer | publisher=McGraw-Hill: New York |date=October 1989 | oclc=19981194 | isbn=978-0-07-031123-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hughes2000"&gt;{{cite web | author=Jim Hughes | title=Tomoko Uemura, R.I.P. | url=http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue0007/hughes.htm | accessdate=2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centerpiece of the work, titled "[[Tomoko Uemura in Her Bath]]", depicted the severe deformation of a child in her mother's arms after the child was exposed to the effects of Chisso's contamination of the water supply. In response to Chisso's beating of W. Eugene Smith for dissemination of the photographs, Smith was awarded the [[Robert Capa Gold Medal]] in 1974 for "best published photographic reporting from abroad requiring exceptional courage and enterprise".&lt;ref name="goldmedal1974"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Robert Capa Gold Medal |publisher=''[[Overseas Press Club]] of America'' |year=1974 |url=http://www.opcofamerica.org/opc_awards/archive/byaward/award_capa.php |accessdate=2007-11-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105202454/http://www.opcofamerica.org/opc_awards/archive/byaward/award_capa.php |archivedate=2007-11-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's "historical overview" in its current website makes no mention of their role in the mass contamination of Minamata and the dreadful aftermath, although a separate section of the website, accessed from the same list as the overview, is devoted to the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chisso.co.jp/minamata/torikumi.html]&lt;/ref&gt; This section, however, is absent from the English version of the website. Additionally, their 2004 Annual Report reports an equivalent of about US$50 million (5,820 million yen) in "Minamata Disease Compensation Liabilities".  From 2000 to 2003, the company also reported total compensation liabilities of over US$170 million. Their 2000 accounts also show that the [[Government of Japan|Japanese]] and [[Kumamoto Prefecture|Kumamoto prefectural]] governments waived an enormous US$560 million in related liabilities. Their FY2004 and FY2005 reports refer to Minamata disease as "[[Mad hatter disease|Mad Hatter's Disease]]", a term coined from the mercury poisoning experienced by hat-makers of the last few centuries (cf [[Mad Hatter]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chisso.co.jp/english/investors/other/80th_e.pdf FY2004] and [http://www.chisso.co.jp/english/investors/other/81th_e.pdf FY2005] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5rKoTAKT1?url=http://www.chisso.co.jp/english/investors/other/81th_e.pdf |date=2010-07-19 }} financial results.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11629">'''Ontario Minamata disease''' is a [[neurology|neurological]] syndrome caused by severe [[mercury poisoning]]. It occurred in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]], in 1970, and severely affected two [[First Nation]] communities in [[Northwestern Ontario]] following consumption of local fish contaminated with [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and one First Nation in [[Southern Ontario]] due to illegal disposal of industrial chemical waste. The disease was named after the infamous case of severe mercury poisoning in the fishing community of [[Minamata, Kumamoto|Minamata]], [[Japan]], which became known as [[Minamata disease]] because it devastated only the residents of the community.

==Source of the mercury pollution==

===Grassy Narrows and Whitedog First Nations===
In 1962, [[Dryden Chemical Company]] began operating a [[chloralkali process]] plant in [[Dryden, Ontario]] using [[chloralkali process#Mercury cell|mercury cells]].&lt;ref name="itri"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=D'ltri, P A  |author2=D'ltri, F M | title=Mercury contamination: A human tragedy | journal=Environmental Management | volume=2 | issue=1 | pages=3–16 |date=January 1978 | issn=1432-1009 | doi=10.1007/BF01866442}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcdonald"&gt;{{cite journal|author=McDonald, A | title=Indigenous peoples' vulnerabilities exposed: Lessons learned from Canada's Minamata incident: An Environmental analysis based on the case study of methyl-mercury pollution in northwestern Ontario, Canada | booktitle=JACS Conference 2007 | publisher=Japanese Association for Canadian Studies | url=http://jacs.jp/AnnualConf2007/JACS2007/JACS2007resume/20070923mcdonald-e.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2007-12-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014080420/http://www.jacs.jp/AnnualConf2007/JACS2007/JACS2007resume/20070923mcdonald-e.pdf |archivedate = 2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It produced [[sodium hydroxide]] and [[chlorine]] that were used in large amounts for [[Bleaching of wood pulp|bleaching]] paper during production by the nearby [[Dryden Pulp and Paper Company]].&lt;ref name="itri"/&gt; Both companies were subsidiaries of the British multinational, [[Reed International]].&lt;ref name="itri"/&gt;

Dryden Chemical Company discharged their effluent directly into the [[Wabigoon River|Wabigoon]]-[[English River (Ontario)|English River]] system. In 1970, extensive mercury contamination was discovered in this river system, leading to closure of the commercial fishery and some tourism related businesses. On March 26, 1970, the Ontario provincial government ordered Dryden Chemical Company to cease dumping mercury into the river system, although the order did not place any restrictions on airborne emissions of mercury by the company.&lt;ref name="mcdonald"/&gt; It was estimated that over 9,000&amp;nbsp;kg of mercury had been dumped by the company into the Wabigoon-English river system between 1962 and 1970.&lt;ref name="mcdonald"/&gt; The airborne emissions of mercury continued unabated until the company stopped using mercury cells in its chloralkali process in October 1975; the company closed down in 1976.&lt;ref name="mcdonald"/&gt;

===Sarnia First Nation===
The [[Aamjiwnaang First Nation]] (the Chippewas of Sarnia) is located on the [[St. Clair River]], affectionately called by the local population as "Chemical Valley."  This First Nation is plagued by numerous chemical affective disorders, including mercury poisoning.  Elders in the community recall collecting mercury from the local toxic waste dump by pouring water, then selling the collected mercury on the [[black market]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webzoom.freewebs.com/killerpillresearch/pollutiononcanadianreservation.pdf "Caught in a toxic web, Canadian natives are alarmed by a shortage of sons"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209082711/http://webzoom.freewebs.com/killerpillresearch/pollutiononcanadianreservation.pdf |date=2012-02-09 }}.

==Health effects==

===Grassy Narrows and Whitedog First Nations===
In the late 1960s, people in the [[Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation|Grassy Narrows]] and [[Wabaseemoong Independent Nations|Whitedog]] First Nations populations started to suffer symptoms of mercury poisoning. Several Japanese doctors who had been involved in studying [[Minamata disease]] in Japan travelled to Canada to investigate the mercury poisoning in these people.&lt;ref name="qcnc"&gt;{{cite book | title=Mercury Poisoning | publisher=Quaker Committee for Native Concerns, Toronto, Canada | volume=CX16 | year=1976 | url=http://www.connexions.org/CxLibrary/CX16.htm | accessdate=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harada"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harada, M, Fujino, T, Akagi, T, and Nishigaki, S | title=Epidemiological and clinical study and historical background of mercury pollution on Indian Reservations in Northwestern Ontario, Canada | journal=Bulletin of the Institute of Constitutional Medicine, [[Kumamoto University]], [[Kumamoto, Japan]] | volume=26 | pages=169–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood mercury levels were above 100&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per billion|ppb]] in a significant number of individuals and above 200&amp;nbsp;ppb in several others.&lt;ref name="harada"/&gt; Symptoms included sensory disturbances, such as narrowing of the [[visual field]], and [[hearing impairment|impaired hearing]], abnormal [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]]s, [[tremor]], [[ataxia]] (impaired balance), and [[dysarthria]] (poor articulation of speech).&lt;ref name="harada"/&gt;

Health effects continued to be felt, even in young people, in the 21st century. Dumping of drums of mercury which continue to leak is suspected.&lt;ref name="NYT41917"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Susan Goldberg|title=The Town Where Mercury Still Rises|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/opinion/the-town-where-mercury-still-rises.html|accessdate=April 19, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits and settlements==

===Grassy Narrows and Whitedog First Nations===
The ''[[Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation|Asabiinyashkosiwagong Nitam-Anishinaabeg]]'' or the "Grassy Narrows First Nation" and their downstream neighbours, the Wabaseemoong Independent Nations (then known as the "Whitedog Community of the Islington Band of Saulteaux") sought compensation for loss of jobs and way of life. On March 26, 1982, Canada contributed $2.2 million to Wabaseemoong for economic development, social and educational programs. Wabaseemoong also signed a settlement with Ontario in January 1983. On July 27, 1984, [[Canadian government|Canada]] contributed $4.4 million to Grassy Narrows for economic development and social service development/planning.&lt;ref name="inac"&gt;[http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/on/ewr_e.html Ontario Region - Information Sheets - English-Wabigoon River Mercury Compensation - Indian and Northern Affairs Canada&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was signed committing government and two companies (Reed Limited, and Great Lakes Forest Products Ltd.) to a one-time compensation payment. In 1986, the Government of Canada's ''Grassy Narrows and Islington Indian Bands Mercury Pollution Claims Settlement Act'' and the Government of Ontario's ''English and Wabigoon River Systems Mercury Contamination Settlement Agreement Act'', facilitated the creation of the Mercury Disability Fund (MDF) and the Mercury Disability Board, based in Kenora, Ontario. The federal and provincial governments, as well as the two companies involved, paid a total of $16.67 million for the MOA compensation. Canada's contribution was $2.75 million. Part of the First Nations' MOA settlement ($2 million) was placed in a trust fund (which the Province of Ontario is responsible for replenishing when the balance drops below $100,000). The Board administers the trust as well as a benefits mechanism.&lt;ref name="inac"/&gt;

Nevertheless, the community members have seen little of this money, due to conditions on its use and bureaucratic requirements by [[band council]]s. Similarly to other First Nations communities, the federal government's [[Indian Act]] governance system has made it difficult for band councils and chiefs to negotiate for their people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://newsocialist.org/newsite/index.php?id=239 |title=New Socialist: Grassy Narrows: History of the fight&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316151257/http://newsocialist.org/newsite/index.php?id=239 |archive-date=2008-03-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief Sakatcheway was the first leader of community when the treaty was signed and mainly wanted education for the community.

{{nihongo|'''''Minamata: The Victims and Their World'''''|水俣 患者さんとその世界||Minamata: Kanja-san to sono sekai}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[documentary]] made in 1971 by [[Noriaki Tsuchimoto]]. It is the first in a series of independent documentaries that Tsuchimoto made of the [[Minamata disease|mercury poisoning incident]] in [[Minamata]], [[Japan]]. Subsequent films in the series include ''[[The Shiranui Sea]]''.

==Film content==
The film focuses on the residents of [[Minamata]] and nearby communities who suffered damage to their nervous systems, or who were born deformed, due to the ingestion of fish containing abnormal amounts of mercury released into the sea by a fertilizer factory owned by [[Chisso]]. It not only shows their current condition and the hardships borne by their families, but also the discrimination they had suffered from other Minamata residents, the insufficient response by Chisso, the slowness of government action, and the problems faced by victims who had not been officially designated as suffering from Minamata disease. 

The victims director Tsuchimoto portrays range from fishermen and the elderly to children born with congenital Minamata disease. The disease ranges in severity and symptoms, manifesting differently in each person. The themes carried throughout these different stories include the immense love of the caretakers and the guardians for those suffering from Minamata disease, as well as worries about these victims’ futures when their families pass away. By showing how some families make the most out of their situation and that rehabilitation is possible, Tsuchimoto humanizes the people ostracized by the community because of their association with Minamata disease. The documentary takes the side of the victims in their struggle, but it also devotes much time to understanding their lifestyle, especially their traditions and their close relationship with the sea.

The main action of the last part of the film is the effort of victims and their supporters to buy shares of Chisso in small quantities so that they can attend the annual stockholders' meeting and confront the corporate leadership. The Minamata demonstrators aim to address the managers and directors of Chisso to no avail, resulting in the demonstrators crowding around the directors. Through heart-wrenching tirades, the demonstrators express their demands for recognition and reparations. It is through powerful scenes such as these that Tsuchimoto’s message of demanding justice is conveyed most effectively. With recent environmental disasters in mind such as the March 2011 [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], Tsuchimoto’s documentary is still relevant and brings up the issues of lack of government and corporate responsibility.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Production ==
As a student activist who identified as a Communist, Tsuchimoto was angered by Chisso, the government, and medical institutions for being complicit in the Minamata disease victims’ suffering (Yasuo, 1995). Having used cinema to portray the lives of Tokyo taxi drivers in his breakthrough film, ''[[On the Road: A Document|On the Road]]'',&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Fujiwara, Chris (September 2011). "DVD: Two documentaries by Tsuchimoto Noriaki". ''Sight and Sound''. BFI. &lt;/ref&gt; contributing to the Minamata disease victims’ struggle for recognition and reparations through cinema was a natural response for Tsuchimoto. Hence, ''Minamata: The Victims and Their World'' came to be without any funding from sponsors. Instead, producer Ryūtarō Takagi essentially crowdsourced funds to produce this documentary as well as future films in the series.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Yasuo, Yoshio; Aaron Gerow (3 October 1995). "Documentarists of Japan, No. 7: Tsuchimoto Noriaki". ''Documentary Box'' (8).&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon criticism for not including any details on the medical aspects of the Minamata disease, Tsuchimoto, who had intended for ''Minamata: The Victims and Their World'' to be his only documentary on the disease, continued his documentary series with the films ''[[Minamata Disease: A Trilogy]]'' and ''[[The Shiranui Sea]].'' New opportunities simultaneously arose: after the court ruling on the Minamata case in 1973, Tsuchimoto was able to use the Medical Faculty of Kumamoto University’s film intended for academic use, which had been mostly undisclosed during the time ''Minamata: The Victims and Their World'' was produced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;    

==Reception==
''Minamata: The Victims and Their World'' screened at numerous film festivals and won several awards, including the Film Ducat at the [[Mannheim-Heidelberg International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards of the 21. International Filmweek Mannheim|url=http://www.iffmh.de/en/1972_Awards_And_Juries|accessdate=4 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110418100835/http://www.iffmh.de/en/1972_Awards_And_Juries|archivedate=18 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Mark Cousins (film critic)|Mark Cousins]] has programmed it as one of "ten documentaries that shook the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Horne|first=Philip|authorlink=Philip Horne|title=Ten documentaries that shook the world|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/3666965/Ten-documentaries-that-shook-the-world.html|accessdate=4 May 2011|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=4 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Claude Lanzmann]], who was invited by director Tsuchimoto to join the latter at a festival celebrating both directors’ works in Tokyo, May 1996, stated, “[…] Tsuchimoto is such a marvelous film-maker, such a rigorous creator, that I followed the film passionately, without ever losing the thread, …”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|date=1996|editor-last=Cousins|editor-first=Mark|editor2-last=Macdonald|editor2-first=Kevin|title=Imagining Reality|doi=10.5040/9780571343232|isbn=9780571343232}}&lt;/ref&gt; which speaks to Tsuchimoto’s skill in bringing out the humanity of people and bringing their relationship with nature, in this case the sea, to life.

The '''Minamata Convention on Mercury''' is an international [[treaty]] designed to protect human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and mercury compounds. This Convention was a result of three years of meeting and negotiating, after which the text of the Convention was approved by delegates representing close to 140 countries on 19 January 2013 in Geneva and adopted and signed later that year on 10 October 2013 at a Diplomatic Conference held in Kumamoto, Japan. The Convention is named after the Japanese city [[Minamata]]. This naming is of symbolic importance as the city went through a [[Minamata disease|devastating incident]] of mercury poisoning. It is expected that over the next few decades, this international agreement will enhance the reduction of mercury pollution from the targeted activities responsible for the major release of mercury to the immediate environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bailey|first1=Marianne|title=Minamata Convention on Mercury|url=http://www2.epa.gov/international-cooperation/minamata-convention-mercury|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background on Mercury ==
[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] is a naturally occurring element. It can be released to the environment from natural sources – such as weathering of mercury-containing rocks, forest fires, volcanic eruptions or geothermal activities – but also from human activities. An estimated 5500-8900 tons of mercury is currently emitted and re-emitted each year to the atmosphere, with much of the re-emitted mercury considered to be related to human activity, as are the direct releases.

Due to its unique properties, mercury has been used in various products and processes for hundreds of years. Currently, it is mostly utilised in industrial processes that produce chlorine (mercury chlor-alkali plants) or vinyl chloride monomer for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) production, and polyurethane elastomers. It is extensively used to extract gold from ore in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. It is contained in products such as electrical switches (including thermostats), relays, measuring and control equipment, energy-efficient fluorescent light bulbs, batteries and dental amalgam. It is also used in laboratories, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, including in vaccines as a preservative, paints, and jewellery. Mercury is also released unintentionally from some industrial processes, such as coal-fired power and heat generation, cement production, mining and other metallurgic activities such as non-ferrous metals production, as well as from incineration of many types of waste.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP, 2013.

== History of the negotiations ==
[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] and mercury compounds have long been known to be toxic to human health and the environment. Large-scale public health crises due to mercury poisoning, such as [[Minamata disease]] and [[Niigata Minamata disease]], drew attention to the issue. In 1972, delegates to the [[Stockholm Conference]] on the Human Environment witnessed Japanese junior high school student Shinobu Sakamoto, disabled as the result of methylmercury poisoning ''in utero''. The [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UN Environment, previously UNEP) was established shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; UN Environment has been actively engaged in bringing the science of mercury poisoning to policy implementation. In 2001, the Executive Director of UN Environment was invited by its Governing Council to undertake a global assessment of mercury and its compounds, including the chemistry and health effects, sources, long-range transport, as well as prevention and control technologies relating to mercury.

In 2003, the Governing Council considered this assessment and found that there was sufficient evidence of significant global adverse impacts from mercury and its compounds to warrant further international action to reduce the risks to human health and the environment from their release to the environment. Governments were urged to adopt goals for the reduction of mercury emissions and releases and UN Environment initiated technical assistance and capacity-building activities to meet these goals.

A mercury programme to address the concerns posed by mercury was established and further strengthened by governments in 2005 and 2007 with the UNEP Global Mercury Partnership. In 2007, the Governing Council concluded that the options of enhanced voluntary measures and new or existing international legal instruments should be reviewed and assessed in order to make progress in addressing the mercury issue. In February 2009, the Governing Council of UNEP decided to develop a global legally binding instrument on mercury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

An intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) was promptly established, through which countries negotiated and developed the text of the convention. Other stakeholders, including intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations also participated in the process and contributed through sharing of views, experience and technical expertise.&lt;ref name="ehp.niehs.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|date=October 2013|title=The Minamata Convention on Mercury: A First Step toward Protecting Future Generations|url=http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/121-a304/|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=121|issue=10|pages=A304–A309|doi=10.1289/ehp.121-A304|last1=Kessler|first1=Rebecca|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee was chaired by Fernando Lugris of [[Uruguay]] and supported by the Chemicals and Health Branch of UN Environment's Economy Division. The INC held five sessions to discuss and negotiate a global agreement on mercury:

In total, the Convention has 128 signatories.

Fernando Lugris, the Uruguayan chair delegate, proclaimed, "Today in the early hours of 19 January 2013 we have closed a chapter on a journey that has taken four years of often intense but ultimately successful negotiations and opened a new chapter towards a sustainable future. This has been done in the name of vulnerable populations everywhere and represents an opportunity for a healthier and more sustainable century for all peoples."&lt;ref name="unep.org"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nuttal|first1=Nick|title=Minamata Convention Agreed by Nations|url=http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=2702&amp;ArticleID=9373&amp;l=en|website=United Nations Environment Programme|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further to the adoption of the Convention, the intergovernmental negotiating committee was mandated to meet during the interim period preceding the opening of the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention to facilitate its rapid entry into force and effective implementation upon entry into force. Two sessions of the INC were held:
* INC 6, 3 to 7 November 2014, in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]
* INC 7, 10 to 15 March 2016, in [[Dead Sea]], [[Jordan]]
Discussions covered a number of technical, financial as well as administrative and operational aspects.

The Convention required to enter into force the deposit of fifty instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession by States or regional economic integration organizations. This fifty-ratification milestone was reached on 18 May 2017, hence the Convention entered into force on 16 August 2017 and held the first meeting of its [[Conference of the parties|Conference of the Parties]] (COP1) from 24 to 29 September 2017 in Geneva.

==Overview of the Convention==
The objective of the Minamata Convention is to protect the human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds. It contains, in support of this objective, provisions that relate to the entire life cycle of mercury, including controls and reductions across a range of products, processes and industries where mercury is used, released or emitted. The treaty also addresses the direct mining of mercury, its export and import, its safe storage and its disposal once as waste. Pinpointing populations at risk, boosting medical care and better training of health-care professionals in identifying and treating mercury-related effects will also result from implementing the Convention.

The Minamata Convention provides controls over a myriad of products containing mercury, the manufacture, import and export of which will be altogether prohibited by 2020, except where countries have requested an exemption for an initial 5-year period. These products include certain types of batteries, compact fluorescent lamps, relays, soaps and cosmetics, thermometers, and blood pressure devices. Dental fillings which use mercury [[Amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]] are also regulated under the Convention, and their use must be phased down through a number of measures.&lt;ref name="unep.org" /&gt;

==Text and provisions==

''Disclaimer : The information below aims at providing a rapid overview of the Convention. It neither represents an interpretation of the text of the Minamata Convention by UN Environment or the Interim Secretariat of the Minamata Convention, nor does it substitute the original authentic texts of the Minamata Convention on Mercury as deposited with the Secretary General of the UN acting as the Depositary.''

The Convention is made of 35 Articles and 5 Annexes, preceded by a Preamble.

The preamble of the Convention states that the Parties have recognized that mercury is, "a chemical of global concern owing to its long-range atmospheric transport, its persistence in the environment once anthropogenically introduced, its ability to bioaccumulate in ecosystems and its significant negative effects on human health and the environment."&lt;ref name="Minamata Convention on mercury"&gt;{{cite web|title=Minamata Convention on mercury|url=http://www.mercuryconvention.org/Portals/11/documents/conventionText/Minamata%20Convention%20on%20Mercury_e.pdf|website=Mercury Convention|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It further refers to previous relevant decisions including of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme as well as to the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development "the future we want". The preamble recalls the lessons of the Minamata disease, in particular the serious safety and environmental effects resulting from mercury pollution and the need to ensure proper management of mercury and the prevention of such events in the future.

The importance of financial, technical, and technological and capacity building support, particularly for developing countries and countries with economies in transition to strengthen national capabilities for the management of mercury and order to promote the proper implementation of the Convention is stressed. The preamble also recognizes the activities of the World Health Organization in the protection of human health related to mercury as well as the roles of relevant multilateral environmental agreements, recognizing that the Convention and other international agreements in the field of environment and trade are mutually supportive.&lt;ref name="Minamata Convention on mercury" /&gt;

=== Article 1 ===

*States the objective of the Convention, which is "to protect the human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds".

=== Article 2 ===
* Sets out definitions used in more than one Article of the Convention, including:
* "Artisanal and small-scale gold mining" which refers to gold mining conducted by individual miners or small enterprises with limited capital investment and production;
* "Best available techniques";
* "Best environmental practices" means using the most appropriate combination of environmental control measures and strategies;
* "Mercury" specifically refers to elemental mercury (Hg), CAS No. 7439-97-6;
* "Mercury compound";
* "Mercury-added product" refers to a product or product component that contains mercury or a mercury compound that was intentionally added;
* "Party" and "Parties present and voting";
* "Primary mercury mining";
* "Regional economic integration organization";
* "Use allowed".

===Article 3===
* Addresses the question of mercury supply sources and trade.
* The provisions of this Article do not apply to mercury compounds used for laboratory research, naturally occurring trace quantities of mercury or mercury compounds present, mercury-added products.
* It prohibits parties to allow mercury mining that was not being conducted prior to the date of entry into force of the Convention for them, and it only allows mercury mining that was conducted at the date of entry into force for up to fifteen years after that date.
* It encourages countries to identify individual stocks of mercury or mercury compounds exceeding 50 metric tons as well as     sources of mercury supply generating stocks exceeding 10 metric tons per year. If excess mercury from the decommissioning of chlor alkali facilities is available, such mercury is disposed of in accordance with the guidelines for environmentally sound management using operations that do not lead to recovery, recycling, reclamation, direct re-use or     alternative uses.
* Parties are not allowed to export mercury without the written consent of the importing Party and only for either environmentally sound interim storage or a use allowed. These controls only apply to mercury, not to either mercury compounds or mercury-added products.

===Article 4===

*Addresses the question of Mercury-added products. 
*The Convention employs two approaches to controlling mercury in products, namely setting a phase-out date for some, and specifying measures to be taken in allowing continued use for others.

===Article 5===
* Deals with manufacturing processes in which mercury or mercury compounds are used.
* Sets out measures either to phase out or to restrict such existing processes.
* It also does not allow the development of new facilities that would use manufacturing processes listed in Annex B and discourages the development of new manufacturing processes in which mercury or mercury compounds are intentionally used.

===Article 6===
* Relates to exemptions available to a Party upon request.
* A State or regional economic integration organization can register for one or more exemptions from the phase out dates listed in Parts I of Annexes A and B.
* They do so on becoming a Party, or in the case of a product or process that is added by amendment to the list, no later than the date upon which that amendment enters into force for it.
* Exemptions can be registered for a listed category or an identified sub-category.
* The registration is made by notifying the Secretariat in writing, and must be accompanied by a statement explaining the Party's need for the exemption.

===Article 7===
* Deals with the question of artisanal and small-scale gold mining and processing in which mercury amalgamation is used to extract gold from ore.
* Each Party that has small-scale gold mining and processing within its territory has the general obligation to take steps to reduce the use of mercury and mercury compounds in such mining and processing needs to reduce, and where feasible eliminate, the use of mercury and mercury compounds in mining and processing, as well as the emissions and releases to the environment of mercury from such activities.
* Additional obligations, including the development and implementation of a national action plan, are laid out for a Party that determines that artisanal and small-scale gold mining and processing in its territory is more than insignificant.

===Article 8===
* Concerns emissions of mercury and mercury compounds.
* It aims at controlling and, where feasible, reducing emissions of mercury and mercury compounds to the atmosphere, through measures to control emissions from the point sources listed in Annex D.
* The Article differentiates between measures required for new sources and those required for existing sources. Releases to land and water are not addressed in Article 8 – they are addressed in Article 9 of the Convention.

===Article 9===
* Addresses the releases of mercury and mercury compounds to land and water
* Aims at controlling and where feasible reducing releases of mercury and mercury compounds from significant anthropogenic point sources that are not addressed in other provisions of the Convention.

===Article 10===
* Applies to the environmentally sound interim storage of mercury other than waste mercury.
* Parties are requested to take measures to ensure that mercury and mercury compounds that are intended for a use allowed under the Convention are stored in an environmentally sound manner, taking into account any guidelines and in accordance with any requirements that the Conference of Parties adopts.

===Article 11===
* Deals with mercury wastes, including their definition, their management in an environmentally sound manner and transportation across international boundaries''.''

===Article 12===
* Deals with contaminated sites.
* Each state needs to endeavour to develop appropriate strategies for identifying and assessing sites contaminated by mercury or mercury compounds.
* When taking action to reduce the risks posed by sites contaminated by mercury or mercury compounds, each Party is required to ensure that actions are performed in an environmentally sound manner, and actions incorporate, where appropriate, an assessment of the risks to human health and the environment from mercury or mercury compounds contained in these sites.

===Article 13===
* Relates to the question of financial resources and mechanism.
* Establishes a mechanism for the provision of adequate, predictable and timely financial resources, comprising the Global Environment Facility Trust Fund and a specific international programme to support capacity building and technical assistance.

===Article 14===
* Addresses the issues of capacity-building, technical assistance and technology transfer.
* Calls for cooperation between Parties to provide timely and appropriate capacity-building and technical assistance to developing country Parties, including through regional, sub regional and national arrangements.

===Article 15===
* Establishes an Implementation and Compliance Committee to promote implementation of, and compliance with, all provisions of this Convention.
* The Committee comprises 15 members nominated by Parties and elected by the Conference of the Parties.
* Issues can be taken up by the Committee on self-referral by a Party, on the basis of information submitted under the reporting provisions, or upon request from the Conference of the Parties.
